Limited studies on the relationship between coronary artery calcium and aortic diameter are present. This study evaluated the correlation between coronary artery calcium score (CACS) and maximal thoracic and abdominal aortic diameters in hypertensive patients, using a noncontrast CT scan. Material(s) and Method(s): We prospectively enrolled 180 hypertensive patients older than 45 who had no aortic aneurysm or heart disease. We split the study population into five classes according to CACS (0, 1-10, 10-100, 100-400, and > 400). We calculated coronary artery calcium and maximal diameters of the ascending thoracic aorta (ATAMAX), descending thoracic aorta (DTAMAX), and abdominal aorta (AAMAX) using native computed tomography imaging. Result(s): Coronary artery calcium score was high in patients with high abdominal aorta diameter but not with the high diameters of the thoracic aorta. The cut-off point of the abdominal aorta's maximum diameter was 34 mm, so AAMAX > 34 mm is predictive of a diagnosis of CACS category five (CACS > 400). There were no differences in ascending and descending thoracic aorta measurements between patients with a coronary artery calcium score of more than 400 (category 5) and the rest. Conclusion(s): Screening for an abdominal aortic aneurysm is essential in hypertensive patients as the coronary artery calcium score is associated significantly with increased abdominal aorta diameter. However, the necessity for thoracic aortic aneurysm screening is not apparent in these patients as no significant association is found between CACS and thoracic aorta diameter.Copyright © 2022 Via Medica.","Authors":"Abdulhussein, S.

This study analyzed limitations of the ABI and toe-brachial index (TBI), if done alone, in patients with symptomatic PAD, diagnosed by duplex ultrasound (DUS) examination, particularly in patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Method(s): This is a retrospective review of prospectively collected data. All patients underwent resting ABIs, TBI, and/or DUS. An ABIs of 0.90 or less in either leg was considered abnormal, and the term inconclusive ABIs (noncompressibility) was used if the ABI was 1.3 or greater. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and overall accuracy (OA) of ABIs in detecting 50% or greater stenosis of any arterial segment based on DUS were determined. A TBI of less than 0.7 was considered abnormal. Result(s): We included 2226 ABIs and 1383 DUS examinations: 46% of patients had diabetes, 16% had CKD, and 39% had coronary artery disease. Fifty-three percent of the ABIs were normal, 34% were abnormal, and 13% were inconclusive. For patients with limb-threatening ischemia, 40% had normal ABIs, 40% abnormal ABIs, and 20% were inconclusive. The sensitivity and OA for ABIs in detecting 50% or greater stenosis in the whole series were 57% (95% confidence interval [CI], 53.7-61.2) and 74% (95% CI, 71.9-76.6); for diabetics 51% (95% CI, 46.1-56.3) and 66% (95% CI, 62.3-69.8); nondiabetics 66% (95% CI, 59.9-70.9) and 81% (95% CI, 78.2-83.9). For patients with CKD, the sensitivity and OA for ABIs in detecting 50% or greater stenosis was 43% (95% CI, 34.3-52.7) and 67% (95% CI, 60.2-73.0) versus patients with no CKD 60% (95% CI, 56.3-64.6) and 76% (95% CI, 73.1-78.1). If patients with inconclusive ABIs were excluded, these values were 69% (95% CI, 65.2-72.9) and 80% (95% CI, 77.2-81.9) in the whole series; 67% (95% CI, 61.6-72.7) and 75% (95% CI, 70.5-78.4) for diabetics; and 63% (95% CI, 51.3-73.0) and 78% (95% CI, 70.6-83.9) for patients with CKD. Thirty-three percent of TBIs were normal and 67% were abnormal. The sensitivity and OA for abnormal TBI in detecting 50% or greater stenosis were 85% (95% CI, 78.9-90.0) and 75% (95% CI, 70.1-80.2) in the whole series; 84% (95% CI, 76.0-90.3) and 74% (95% CI, 67.1-80.2) for diabetics; and 77% (95% CI, 61.4-88.2) and 72% (95% CI, 59.9-82.3) for patients with CKD. For those with inconclusive ABIs, these values for TBI were 75% and 69%. Conclusion(s): Of symptomatic patients with PAD with 50% or greater stenosis on DUS examination, 43% had normal/inconclusive resting ABIs (49% in diabetics and 57% in CKD). TBI may help in patients with inconclusive ABIs. These patients should undergo further imaging to determine proper treatment.Copyright © 2019 Society for Vascular Surgery","Authors":"AbuRahma, A.

Therefore, our goal was to assess the additive value of copeptin for early diagnosis and prognosis of Non-ST segment acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS). Method(s): The study included ninety patients with suspected ACS. Patients with typical ischemic chest pain within six hours of symptom onset and without ST-segment elevation on electrocardiograph (ECG) were included. In addition to cardiac troponin I (cTn[sbnd]I), copeptin was assayed from venous blood samples obtained on admission, followed by serial troponin measurements six and twelve hours later. One year follow-up was performed for any major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) including cardiac death, re-infarction, re- hospitalization for ischemic events, heart failure, stroke and target lesion revascularization (TLR). Result(s): Of seventy nine patients included in the final analysis, Forty (50.6%) were diagnosed as unstable angina (UA), while thirty nine (49.4%) had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Copeptin level on admission was significantly higher among NSTEMI patients than those with UA. With regard to the correlation analyses, copeptin was positively correlated with each of, Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE), Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) and synergy between percutaneous coronary intervention with taxus and cardiac surgery (SYNTAX) scores. The sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) of the combination of admission copeptin and cTn-I were 100% and 100%, respectively, versus 57% and 70%, respectively, with admission of cTn-I alone. The area under curve (AUC) of the combination of copeptin and cTn-I was (0.975, p < 0.001) and was significantly higher than the AUC of cTn-I alone (0.888, p < 0.001). Admission copeptin was an independent predictor for MACEs by multiple regression analysis (OR: 0.01, 95% CI: 0.0-0.8, P = 0.04). High values of copeptin had the highest rate of MACEs and coronary revascularization during one year of follow up. Conclusion(s): The combination of copeptin and conventional troponin I aids in early rule out of NSTEMI virtually independent of chest pain onset (CPO) with high NPV in patients presenting within three hours from chest pain onset with excellent prognostic value for risk stratification and prediction of MACEs.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Authors":"Ahmed, T.

After-effects of diabetic cardiomyopathy are far more lethal than non-diabetic cardiomyopathy. More than 300 million people suffer from diabetes and cardiovascular disorder which is expected to be elevated to an alarming figure of 450 million by 2030. Recent studies suggested that miRNA plays important role in the onset of diabetic cardiomyopathy. This study was designed to identify the miRNA that is responsible for the onset of diabetic cardiomyopathy using in silico and in vitro approaches. In this study, to identify the miRNA responsible for the onset of diabetic cardiomyopathy, in silico analysis was done to predict the role of these circulating miRNAs in type 2 diabetic cardiomyopathy. Shared miRNAs that are present in both diseases were selected for further analysis. Total RNA and miRNA were extracted from blood samples taken from type 2 diabetic patients as well as healthy controls to analyze the expression of important genes like AKT, VEGF, IGF, FGF1, ANGPT2 using Real-time PCR. The expression of ANGPT2 was up-regulated and AKT, VEGF, IGF, FGF1 were down-regulated in DCM patients as compared to healthy controls. The miRNA expression of miR-17 was up-regulated and miR-24, miR-150, miR-199a, miR-214, and miR-320a were down-regulated in the DCM patients as compared to healthy controls. This shows that dysregulation of target genes and miRNA may contribute towards the pathogenesis of DCM and more studies should be conducted to elucidate the role of circulating miRNAs to use them as therapeutic and diagnostic options.","Authors":"Ahmed, Uzair; Ashfaq, Usman Ali; Qasim, Muhammad; Ahmad, Imtiaz; Ahmad, Hafiz Usman; Tariq, Muhammad; Masoud, Muhammad Shareef; Khaliq, Saba","Publisher":"PloS one","Issue":"4","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0250773","Pages":"e0250773","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"miRNA"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":3,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":55,"Title":"Diagnostic Potential of Autophagy-5 Protein, Apolipoprotein B-48, and Oxidative Stress Markers in Serum of Patients with Early-Stage Ischemic Stroke","Year":2022,"Country":"","Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Strokes are among the leading causes of death worldwide and have different characteristics. Different physiopathological mechanisms characterize the numerous subtypes of ischemic stroke (IS). In this study, we investigated the relationship between serum levels of autophagy-5 protein, apolipoprotein B-48, and oxidative stress markers in patients with ischemic stroke., METHODS: For this study, 100 participants were recruited, of which 50 were patients with IS and 50 were healthy individuals. We conducted a case-control study at Imam Reza Hospital from March 2019 to April 2020. Serum levels of ATG5, apo B-48, and oxidative stress markers were determined in both groups. Our Receiver Operating Characteristic Analysis evaluated the additional diagnostic value of these factors in both groups., RESULTS: Diabetes, smoking, age, sex, alcohol consumption, weight, and height did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (P > 0.05). However, the 2 groups had significant differences in hypertension and body mass index (P < 0.05). Fifty-four percent (27 patients) of patients with IS had an ischemic stroke in large vessels, while 46% (23 patients) had an ischemic stroke in small vessels. Serum levels of ATG5, apo B-48, and oxidative stress markers were higher in the case group than in the control group (P < 0.0001)., CONCLUSIONS: In patients with IS, serum levels of ATG5, apoB-48, malonaldehyde, total oxidative stress, and total antioxidant capacity can be used as novel biomarkers to predict or treat the disease.

However, automated detection and identification of CMBs in Magnetic Resonance (MR) images is a very challenging task due to their wide distribution throughout the brain, small sizes, and the high degree of visual similarity between CMBs and CMB mimics such as calcifications, irons, and veins. In this paper, we propose a fully automated two-stage integrated deep learning approach for efficient CMBs detection, which combines a regional-based You Only Look Once (YOLO) stage for potential CMBs candidate detection and three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (3D-CNN) stage for false positives reduction. Both stages are conducted using the 3D contextual information of microbleeds from the MR susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) and phase images. However, we average the adjacent slices of SWI and complement the phase images independently and utilize them as a two-channel input for the regional-based YOLO method. This enables YOLO to learn more reliable and representative hierarchal features and hence achieve better detection performance. The proposed work was independently trained and evaluated using high and low in-plane resolution data, which contained 72 subjects with 188 CMBs and 107 subjects with 572 CMBs, respectively. The results in the first stage show that the proposed regional-based YOLO efficiently detected the CMBs with an overall sensitivity of 93.62% and 78.85% and an average number of false positives per subject (FPavg) of 52.18 and 155.50 throughout the five-folds cross-validation for both the high and low in-plane resolution data, respectively. These findings outperformed results by previously utilized techniques such as 3D fast radial symmetry transform, producing fewer FPavg and lower computational cost. The 3D-CNN based second stage further improved the detection performance by reducing the FPavg to 1.42 and 1.89 for the high and low in-plane resolution data, respectively. The outcomes of this work might provide useful guidelines towards applying deep learning algorithms for automatic CMBs detection.Copyright © 2020","Authors":"Al-masni, M. A.; Kim, W. R.; Kim, E.

The simultaneous assessment of multiple IMO&NS biomarkers may be useful to predict IS and its prognosis. The aim of this study was to identify the IMO&NS biomarkers, which predict short-term IS outcome. The study included 176 IS patients and 176 healthy controls. Modified Rankin scale (mRS) was applied within 8 h after IS (baseline) and 3 months later (endpoint). Blood samples were obtained within 24 h after hospital admission. IS was associated with increased white blood cell (WBC) counts, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin (IL-6), lipid hydroperoxides (LOOHs), nitric oxide metabolites (NOx), homocysteine, ferritin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), glucose, insulin, and lowered iron, 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. We found that 89.4% of the IS patients may be correctly classified using the cumulative effects of male sex, systolic blood pressure (SBP), glucose, NOx, LOOH, 25(OH)D, IL-6, and WBC with sensitivity of 86.2% and specificity of 93.0%. Moreover, increased baseline disability (mRS >= 3) was associated with increased ferritin, IL-6, hsCRP, WBC, ESR, and glucose. We found that 25.0% of the variance in the 3-month endpoint (mRS) was explained by the regression on glucose, ESR, age (all positively), and HDL-cholesterol, and 25(OH)D (both negatively).

The myocardial performance index (MPI) was defined as [(IVCT + IVRT)/ET]. Our aim was to investigate if cardiac time intervals can be used to predict atrial fibrillation (AF) in the general population. Methods and Results: A total of 1915 participants from the general population underwent a health examination including TDI echocardiography. The primary endpoint was AF, and the secondary endpoint was complicated AF as assessed by the occurrence of either stroke or heart failure (HF) after the diagnosis of AF. Participants with known AF were excluded (n = 54). During a median follow-up of 11 years, 166 participants (9%) were diagnosed with AF and of these 44 participants (27%) developed HF or stroke. Assessing the association between IVCT and incident AF, the risk increased with 27% per 10 ms increase in IVCT [per 10 ms increase: hazard ratio (HR) 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.17-1.38); P < 0.001]. The association remained significant after multivariable adjustment [per 10 ms increase: HR 1.22, 95% CI (1.09-1.35); P < 0.001]. No associations between the IVRT, ET, MPI, and AF remained significant after multivariable adjustment. The IVCT also predicted complicated AF and the association remained significant even after multivariable adjustment [per 10 ms increase: HR 1.39, 95% CI (1.06-1.81); P = 0.015]. Conclusion(s): In the general population, the IVCT provides novel and independent prognostic information on the long-term risk of AF. Additionally, the IVCT can identify persons in risk of complicated AF.Copyright © 2019 Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

In this study, we investigated levels of NT-proBNP in patients with PAD compared to non-PAD controls. A total of 355 patients were recruited from outpatient clinics at a tertiary care hospital network. Plasma NT-proBNP levels were quantified using protein multiplex. There were 279 patients with both clinical and diagnostic features of PAD and 76 control patients without PAD (non-PAD cohort). Compared with non-PAD patients, median (IQR) NT-proBNP levels in PAD patients were significantly higher (225 ng/L (120-363) vs 285 ng/L (188-425), p- value = 0.001, respectively). Regression analysis demonstrated that NT-proBNP remained significantly higher in patients with PAD relative to non-PAD despite adjusting for age, sex, hypercholesterolemia, smoking and hypertension [odds ratio = 1.28 (1.07-1.54), p-value <0.05]. Subgroup analysis showed elevated NT-proBNP levels in patients with PAD regardless of prior history of CHF, CAD, diabetes and hypercholesteremia (p-value <0.05). Finally, spearmen's correlation analysis demonstrated a negative correlation between NT-proBNP and ABI (rho = -0.242; p-value < 0.001).

We sought to evaluate the relationship between the dimensionless index (DI)-the ratio of the left ventricular outflow tract time-velocity integral to that of the aortic valve jet-and mortality in these patients. Methods Seven hundred fifty-five patients with LG severe AS (defined by aortic valve area <=1 cm2 or aortic valve area indexed to body surface area <=0.6 cm2/m2 and mean aortic pressure gradient <40 mm Hg) and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction >=50% were studied.

Method(s): The clinical, laboratory, and brain/cardiac imaging characteristics of consecutive ischemic stroke patients without documented AF were recorded. All patients underwent at least 72 h of cardiac monitoring unless AF was diagnosed before, transthoracic echocardiogram, blood biomarkers, and intracranial vessels imaging. A predictive grading was developed by logistic regression analysis, the screening for atrial fibrillation scale (SAFE). Result(s): A total of 460 stroke patients were analyzed to develop the SAFE scale, a 7-items score (possible total score 0-10): age >= 65 years (2 points); history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or obstructive sleep apnea (1 point); thyroid disease (1 point); NT-proBNP >= 250 pg/ml (2 points); left atrial enlargement (2 points); cortical topography of stroke, including hemispheric or cerebellar cortex (1 point); and intracranial large vessel occlusion (1 point). A score = 5 identified patients with paroxysmal AF with a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 80%. Conclusion(s): Screening for atrial fibrillation scale (SAFE) is a novel and simple strategy for selecting ischemic stroke patients at higher risk of having AF who can benefit from a more thorough etiological evaluation. External validation of SAFE in a multicenter study, with a larger number of patients, is warranted.Copyright © 2022 Amaya Pascasio, Quesada Lopez, Garcia-Torrecillas, Arjona-Padillo and Martinez Sanchez.","Authors":"Amaya Pascasio, L.; Quesada Lopez, M.; Garcia-Torrecillas, J.

Method(s): In this prospective, nested case-control study from northern Sweden, 87 candidate cardiovascular protein biomarkers were studied in 244 individuals who later died within 24 h from an incident MI and 244 referents without MI and individually matched for age, sex and date of health examination and alive at the date of event in the index person. Association analysis was conducted using conditional logistic regression. Bonferroni correction was applied to avoid false positive findings. Result(s): Ten proteins were associated with future SCD due to acute MI in the non-adjusted analysis. The strongest association were found for growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.79 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.41, 2.25) per standard deviation increase in protein, and urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor with an OR of 1.66 (95% CI 1.34, 2.06).

Participants included 1698 consecutive patients aged 35 to 85 years with 2 or more coronary risk factors but no history of CAD who presented with suspected myocardial ischemia to undergo stress CMR imaging. The study was conducted from February 18, 2019, to March 1, 2020., Main Outcomes and Measures: Cardiovascular (CV) death and nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI). Major adverse CV events (MACE) including CV death, nonfatal MI, hospitalization for heart failure or unstable angina, and late, unplanned coronary artery bypass graft surgery., Results: Of the 1698 patients, 873 were men (51.4%); mean (SD) age was 62 (11) years, accounting for 67 CV death/nonfatal MIs and 190 MACE. Clinical models of pretest risk were constructed and patients were categorized using guideline-based categories of low (<1% per year), intermediate (1%-3% per year), and high (>3% year) risk. Stress CMR imaging provided risk reclassification across all baseline models. For CV death/nonfatal MI, adding stress CMR-assessed left ventricular ejection fraction, presence of ischemia, and late gadolinium enhancement to a model incorporating the validated CAD Consortium score, hypertension, smoking, and diabetes provided significant net reclassification improvement of 0.266 (95% CI, 0.091-0.441) and C statistic improvement of 0.086 (95% CI, 0.022-0.149). Stress CMR imaging reclassified 60.3% of patients in the intermediate pretest risk category (52.4% reclassified as low risk and 7.9% as high risk) with corresponding changes in the observed event rates of 0.6% per year for low posttest risk and 4.9% per year for high posttest risk. For MACE, stress CMR imaging further provided significant net reclassification improvement (0.361; 95% CI, 0.255-0.468) and C statistic improvement (0.092; 95% CI, 0.054-0.131), and reclassified 59.9% of patients in the intermediate pretest risk group (48.7% reclassified as low risk and 11.2% as high risk)., Conclusions and Relevance: In this multicenter cohort of patients with no history of CAD presenting with suspected myocardial ischemia, stress CMR imaging reclassified patient risk across guideline-based risk categories, beyond clinical risk factors. The findings of this study support the value of stress CMR imaging for clinical decision-making, especially in patients at intermediate risk for CV death and nonfatal MI.","Authors":"Antiochos, Panagiotis; Ge, Yin; Steel, Kevin; Chen, Yi-Yun; Bingham, Scott; Abdullah, Shuaib; Mikolich, J.

The UACR at the time of insulin initiation was measured and categorized as <10, 10- 29, 30-300 and >300 mg/g.

We aimed to investigate the association of estrogen receptor-alpha (ESR1) gene polymorphism c454-397T>C with serum estradiol levels and dyslipidemia in 220 patients with MI in the age range of 35-70 years of both the genders. Genotyping study was performed through PCR-RFLP method using PvuII restriction enzyme. Serum estradiol level was estimated using the Access Sensitive Estradiol assay kit. Men patients had 43.2% increased risk for TC heterozygote in co-dominant (OR 10.66) and over-dominant models (OR 8.30), while women patients had 50% increased risk in co-dominant (OR 16.57) and over-dominant (OR 14.04) models. Variant C allele showed 25% increased risk of MI for in men (OR 2.24; CI 1.49-3.36; p = 0.0001), and 24% increased risk in women (OR 3.35; CI 1.95-5.76; p = 0.0001). Men patients had significantly increased serum estradiol levels compared to controls (25.28 +/- 5.80 vs 17.04 +/- 2.01; p < 0.0001). Significant difference was observed in estradiol levels between men and women patients (25.28 +/- 5.80 vs 17.56 +/- 3.32; p < 0.0001). Furthermore, significantly increased estradiol level was found in men patients compared to women for TT (25.46 +/- 5.91 vs 16.71 +/- 4.46; p < 0.0001), and TC genotypes (25.47 +/- 5.91 vs 17.70 +/- 2.86; p < 0.0001). Significantly increased HDL levels were observed in men patients with TC (43.10 +/- 8.18 vs 38.91 +/- 7.84; p < 0.01) and CC (47.16 +/- 8.09 vs 38.91 +/- 7.84; p < 0.001) genotypes compared to TT genotype.

Multivariable models identified gender as a significant effect modifier for imaging variables of CAD. For males, a supine summed stress score (SSS) >= 3 provided high accuracy (sensitivity 70.7%, specificity 72.2%), and highest contribution to multivariable models. In females, supine SSS >= 2 provided the best cut-off for defect size and severity (sensitivity 90%, specificity 35.9%), but specificity was improved substantially to 53.3% with decrease in sensitivity to 80% by also requiring quantitative identification of perfusion defect reversibility in the supine position. Eight variables, accurate for predicting coronary disease, were more accurate with supine than upright imaging., CONCLUSIONS: Perfusion defect reversibility improved specificity in female patients for detection of coronary disease compared to perfusion defect size and extent alone.

Arylesterase (ARE) activities have been considered as an anti-atherosclerosis factor. Increased pulse pressure (PP) may lead to a high risk of coronary artery disease and neurovascular morbidity and mortality. Nevertheless, there are limitations for PP as an evaluation index. In order to overcome the defects of PP, there is a novel parameter, \"pulse pressure/systolic pressure\" named \"pulse pressure index (PPI)\" for evaluation of cardiovascular effect. We researched the relationship between ARE activities and pulse pressure index (PPI) in acute ischemic stroke patients. We evaluated and compared the ARE activity and PPI in 87 ischemic stroke patients and 48 control patients. ARE activity was measured with the ultraviolet (UV) spectrophotometric method by using \"Rel Assay Diagnostic\" kits. Pulse pressure was measured by subtraction of diastolic blood pressure from systolic blood pressure. PPI was calculated as \"pulse pressure / systolic pressure\". Hypertension, age, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia importantly higher in ischemic stroke patients than the control group (p<0.05). PPI was significantly higher in ischemic stroke patients than the control group (0.486+/-0.075 and 0.417+/-0.051, p<0.05). ARE activity was significantly lower in ischemic stroke patients than in the control group (511.59 +/- 68.51 and 584.16 +/- 81.74 p=0.019). This study demonstrated that ARE activity is lower and PPI is higher in acute ischemic stroke patients than control subjects. Our results suggested that, ARE activity and PPI are important risk factors in acute ischemic stroke patients.Copyright © 2021 Ondokuz Mayis Universitesi.

N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is an important biomarker in cardiovascular diseases. This study aimed to address the incremental usefulness of the combined use of high-sensitivity sST2 and NT-proBNP for predicting the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD)., METHODS: We used patient data along with data established by our research group to compare the performance of a combination of biomarkers reflecting ventricular fibrosis, remodeling, stretch and deterioration of cardiac function (sST2 and NT-proBNP) with that of established mortality risk factors [age, diabetes, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), body mass index (BMI), creatinine (Cr), uric acid (UA), glucose (Glu)] in stratifying the risk of MACEs in CHD patients., RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 3.9 years, during which time there were 3,724 cases with CHD, 113 cases of cardiovascular death, 30 cases with myocardial infarction, 49 cases with stroke, 39 cases of non-cardiovascular death, 6 cases of peripheral arterial occlusion, 55 cases with HF, and 73 cases of revascularization. A total of 365 cases had MACEs. In the multivariate Cox proportional hazard model, both sST2 and NT-proBNP were significant predictors of MACEs. Both sST2 and NT-proBNP were separately incorporated into the model with established MACE risk factors, which significantly improved the C-statistics for predicting MACEs [0.758 (0.724-0.792)] and saw an estimated net improvement in reclassification of 1.03% (P<0.001) and an integrated discrimination improvement of 0.48% (P<0.001). The Hosmer-Lemeshow test showed that the models were well calibrated with and without the two biomarkers (P>0.344 for all comparisons). Moreover, the model incorporating the two biomarkers was shown to have a better global fit than the model with only the established MACE risk factors (P<0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: A model incorporating sST2 and NT-proBNP was shown to outperform a model based on established MACE risk factors alone in stratifying risk of MACEs in a group of CHD patients.","Authors":"Bai, Jing; Han, Lina; Liu, Hongbin","Publisher":"Annals of palliative medicine","Issue":"4","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.21037/apm-20-1046","Pages":"1976-1989","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"combined use of high-sensitivity serum soluble ST (sST2) & N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide NT-proBNP"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":10,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":3,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":18,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":244,"Title":"Matrix metalloproteinases and their gene polymorphism in young ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction","Year":2022,"Country":"","Abstract":"Background: Genetic polymorphism in MMPs are associated with multiple adverse CV events. There is little evidence regarding role of MMPs and their genetic polymorphisms in young (<50 years) ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. Method(s): This study included 100 young (18-50 years) STEMI patients and 100 healthy controls. Serum levels of MMP-3, MMP-9 and TIMP were estimated for both patients as well as controls. Additionally, genetic polymorphisms in the MMP-9 gene (-1562 C/T and R279Q) & MMP-3 gene (5A/6A-1612) was evaluated. All these patients were followed up for one year and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) were determined. Result(s): Serum levels of MMP-3 (128.16 +/- 115.81 vs 102.3 +/- 57.28 ng/mL; P = 0.04), MMP-9 (469.63 +/- 238.4 vs 188.88 +/- 94.08 pg/mL; P < 0.0001) and TIMP (5.84 +/- 1.93 vs 2.28 +/- 1.42 ng/mL; P < 0.0001) were significantly higher in patients as compared to controls. Additionally, patients with genetic polymorphisms in the MMP genes (5A/5A, 6A/6A and the AG genotypes) had an increased risk of STEMI. Patients with MACE had significantly higher levels of MMP-9 (581.73 +/- 260.93 vs 438.01 +/- 223.38 pg/mL; P = 0.012).

Methods and Results Patients who underwent cardiac computed tomography and had chest pain were included. The CAD2 clinical model comprised of age, sex, symptom typicality, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking status and was compared with the CAD2 extended model that added CAC to assess the incremental value of CAC scoring, as well as to the corresponding locally calibrated local assessment of the heart models. A total of 522 patients were analyzed (mean age 54+/-11 years, 43.1% female). The CAD2 clinical model obtained an area under the curve of 0.718 (95% CI, 0.668-0.767).

The influence of troponin I (TNI) value and cortisol value (CV) on cardiopulmonary events within the first 24 hours of ICU treatment was reported in subarachnoid hemorrhage patients, but not in ICH patients up to now. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of early serum biomarkers on IHM and TNI value and CV on cardiopulmonary events within the first 24 hours of ICU treatment. Patients and Methods A total of 329 patients with spontaneous ICH were retrospectively analyzed. Blood samples were taken on admission to measure serum biomarkers. The TNI value and CV were defined as biomarkers for cardiopulmonary stress. Demographic data, cardiopulmonary parameters, including norepinephrine application rate (NAR) in microgram per kilogram per minute and inspiratory oxygen fraction (FiO2) within the first 24 hours, and treatment regime were analyzed concerning their impact on ICU treatment and in hospital outcome. Binary logistic analysis was used to identify independent prognostic factors for IHM. Results Patients with initially nonelevated CVs required higher NAR (p = 0.01) and FiO2(p = 0.046) within the first 24 hours of ICU treatment. Lower cholinesterase level (p = 0.004), higher NAR (p = 0.002), advanced age (p < 0.0001), larger ICH volume (p < 0.0001), presence of intraventricular hemorrhage (p = 0.007) and hydrocephalus (p = 0.009), raised level of C-reactive protein (p = 0.024), serum lactate (p = 0.003), and blood glucose (p = 0.05) on admission were significantly associated with IHM. In a multivariate model, age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.055; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.026-1.085; p < 0.0001), ICH volume (OR: 1.016; CI: 1.008-1.025; p < 0.0001), and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score (OR: 0.680; CI: 0.605-0.764; p < 0.0001) on admission as well as requiring NAR (OR: 1.171; CI: 1.026-1.337; p = 0.02) and FiO2(OR: 0.951; CI: 0.921-0.983, p = 0.003) within the first 24 hours were independent predictors of IHM. Conclusion Higher levels of C-reactive protein, serum lactate, blood glucose, and lower cholinesterase level on admission were significantly associated with IHM. Patients with initially nonelevated CVs required higher NAR and FiO2within the first 24 hours of ICU treatment. Furthermore, requiring an NAR > 0.5 mug/kg/min or an FiO2> 0.21 were identified as additional independent predictors for IHM. These results could be helpful to improve ICU treatment in ICH patients.Copyright © 2020 Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc..

However, existing predictive models offer insufficient performance, particularly for assessing the risk of intracranial haemorrhage. We aimed to develop new risk scores incorporating clinical variables and cerebral microbleeds, an MRI biomarker of intracranial haemorrhage and ischaemic stroke risk. Method(s): We did a pooled analysis of individual-patient data from the Microbleeds International Collaborative Network (MICON), which includes 38 hospital-based prospective cohort studies from 18 countries. All studies recruited participants with previous ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack, acquired baseline MRI allowing quantification of cerebral microbleeds, and followed-up participants for ischaemic stroke and intracranial haemorrhage. Participants not taking antithrombotic drugs were excluded. We developed Cox regression models to predict the 5-year risks of intracranial haemorrhage and ischaemic stroke, selecting candidate predictors on biological relevance and simplifying models using backward elimination. We derived integer risk scores for clinical use. We assessed model performance in internal validation, adjusted for optimism using bootstrapping. The study is registered on PROSPERO, CRD42016036602. Finding(s): The included studies recruited participants between Aug 28, 2001, and Feb 4, 2018. 15 766 participants had follow-up for intracranial haemorrhage, and 15 784 for ischaemic stroke. Over a median follow-up of 2 years, 184 intracranial haemorrhages and 1048 ischaemic strokes were reported. The risk models we developed included cerebral microbleed burden and simple clinical variables. Optimism-adjusted c indices were 0.73 (95% CI 0.69-0.77) with a calibration slope of 0.94 (0.81-1.06) for the intracranial haemorrhage model and 0.63 (0.62-0.65) with a calibration slope of 0.97 (0.87-1.07) for the ischaemic stroke model. There was good agreement between predicted and observed risk for both models. Interpretation(s): The MICON risk scores, incorporating clinical variables and cerebral microbleeds, offer predictive value for the long-term risks of intracranial haemorrhage and ischaemic stroke in patients prescribed antithrombotic therapy for secondary stroke prevention; external validation is warranted.

Hence, there is a need to understand the pathophysiology of AF/stroke in HCM. In this retrospective study, we develop and apply a data-driven, machine learning-based method to identify AF cases, and clinical/imaging features associated with AF, using electronic health record data. Method(s): HCM patients with documented paroxysmal/persistent/permanent AF (n = 191) were considered AF cases, and the remaining patients in sinus rhythm (n = 640) were tagged as No-AF. We evaluated 93 clinical variables; the most informative variables useful for distinguishing AF from No-AF cases were selected based on the 2-sample t test and the information gain criterion. Result(s): We identified 18 highly informative variables that are positively (n = 11) and negatively (n = 7) correlated with AF in HCM. Next, patient records were represented via these 18 variables. Data imbalance resulting from the relatively low number of AF cases was addressed via a combination of oversampling and undersampling strategies. We trained and tested multiple classifiers under this sampling approach, showing effective classification. Specifically, an ensemble of logistic regression and naive Bayes classifiers, trained based on the 18 variables and corrected for data imbalance, proved most effective for separating AF from No-AF cases (sensitivity = 0.74, specificity = 0.70, C-index = 0.80). Conclusion(s): Our model (HCM-AF-Risk Model) is the first machine learning-based method for identification of AF cases in HCM. This model demonstrates good performance, addresses data imbalance, and suggests that AF is associated with a more severe cardiac HCM phenotype.Copyright © 2021 The Authors","Authors":"Bhattacharya, M.; Lu, D.

Here, we postulate that circulating serum-derived micro RNAs (miRNAs) may serve as potential biomarkers for early IHD diagnosis and support the identification of diabetic individuals with a predisposition to undergo IHD. We obtained serum samples from T2DM patients either with IHD or IHD-free and analysed the expression levels of 798 miRNAs using the NanoString nCounter technology platform. The prediction of the putative miRNAs targets was performed using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was used to identify the biological function and signalling pathways associated with miRNA target genes. Hub genes of protein-protein interaction (PPI) network were identified by STRING database and Cytotoscape tool. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to assess the diagnostic value of identified miRNAs. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used for nCounter platform data validation. Our data showed that six miRNAs (miR-615-3p, miR-3147, miR-1224-5p, miR-5196-3p, miR-6732-3p, and miR-548b-3p) were significantly upregulated in T2DM IHD patients compared to T2DM patients without IHD. Further analysis indicated that 489 putative target genes mainly affected the endothelin-1 signalling pathway, glucocorticoid biosynthesis, and apelin cardiomyocyte signalling pathway. All tested miRNAs showed high diagnostic value (AUC = 0.779 - 0.877). Taken together, our research suggests that circulating miRNAs might have a crucial role in the development of IHD in diabetic patients and may be used as a potential biomarker for early diagnosis.Copyright © 2022 Bielska, Niemira, Bauer, Sidorkiewicz, Szalkowska, Skwarska, Raczkowska, Ostrowski, Gugala, Dobrzycki and Kretowski.","Authors":"Bielska, A.; Niemira, M.; Bauer, W.; Sidorkiewicz, I.; Szalkowska, A.; Skwarska, A.; Raczkowska, J.; Ostrowski, D.; Gugala, K.; Dobrzycki, S.; Kretowski, A.","Publisher":"Frontiers in Endocrinology","Issue":"Not Available","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2022.888948","Pages":"888948","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"miRNA profile"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":311,"Title":"Diagnostic value of circulating microRNAs compared to high-sensitivity troponin T for the detection of non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction","Year":2021,"Country":"","Abstract":"Aims: To assess the diagnostic value of microRNAs (miRNAs) for the detection of non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Methods and Results: A total of 1042 patients presenting between August 2014 and April 2017 to the emergency department with the suspected acute coronary syndrome were included. Non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction was diagnosed per criteria of the fourth Universal definition of myocardial infarction (UDMI) using high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-cTnT). Expression levels of eleven microRNAs (miR-21, miR-22, miR-29a, miR-92a, miR-122, miR-126, miR-132, miR-133, miR-134, miR-191, and miR-423) were determined using RT-qPCR. Discrimination of NSTEMI was assessed for individual and a panel of miRNAs compared to the hs-cTnT reference using C-statistics and reclassification analysis. NSTEMI was diagnosed in 137 (13.1%) patients. The area under the curve (AUC) of the hs-cTnT based reference was 0.937. In a multivariate model, three miRNAs (miR-122, miR-133, and miR-134) were found to be associated with NSTEMI with AUCs between 0.506 and 0.656. A panel consisting of these miRNAs revealed an AUC of 0.662 for the diagnosis of NSTEMI. The AUC of the combination of the miRNA panel and troponin reference was significantly lower than the reference standard (AUC: 0.897 vs. 0.937, P = 0.006). Despite a significant improvement of NSTEMI reclassification measured by IDI and NRI, miRNAs did not improve the specificity of hs-cTnT kinetic changes for the diagnosis of NSTEMI (DELTAAUC: 0.04). Conclusion(s): Although single miRNAs are significantly associated with the diagnosis of NSTEMI a miRNA panel does not add diagnostic accuracy to the hs-cTnT reference considering baseline values and kinetic changes as recommended by the fourth version of UDMI.Copyright © 2021 Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

Till date, no Indian data exist regarding role of GLS in stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) and data showing correlation of GLS and SYNTAX score (SS) is meager in world literature. Our aim was to ascertain the role of GLS in SIHD. Method(s): One hundred and seventeen subjects with angina and normal transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) underwent strain echocardiography and coronary angiography (CAG). Result(s): There was significant correlation between GLS and SS values (R2 =.686, P <.0001). The correlation was weaker yet significant in the low SS (<22) group (R2 =.491, P <.0001) and high SS (>=22) group (R2 =.602, P <.0001). The cutoff value of GLS to detect significant CAD was -16.5 (87.6% sensitivity, 85.7% specificity, P <.0001), to predict high SS was -13.5% (sensitivity 78.3%, specificity 87.9%, P <.0001) and to predict triple vessel disease (TVD) was -14.5 (95.7% sensitivity, 73.4% specificity, P <.0001). The agreement between GLS and CAG for detection of significant CAD was substantial (kappa = 0. 676, P <.0001), similar to that between territorial strain and CAG in detecting LAD disease (kappa = 0.688, P <.0001) while agreement between strain imaging and CAG for detecting number of vessels diseased was moderate (kappa = 0.406, P <.0001). Conclusion(s): Global longitudinal peak systolic strain must be conducted on subjects with angina and inconclusive electrocardiogram (ECG) findings to rule out significant CAD even if conventional TTE was normal. This may facilitate early diagnosis of CAD or sub-clinical left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD), preventive or treatment measures, and overall cost savings.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","Authors":"Biswas, K.; Mukherjee, A.; Nandi, S.; Khanra, D.; Sharma, R.

Data to enable evaluation of the T-MACS, HEART, TIMI and EDACS decision aids (without recalibration) were prospectively collected, blinded to patient outcome. We tested admission blood samples for high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI; Siemens ADVIA Centaur). Patients also underwent serial cardiac troponin testing over 3-12 hours. The target condition was an adjudicated diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We also evaluated the incidence of major adverse cardiac events (including death, AMI or coronary revascularisation) at 30 days. Diagnostic accuracy of each decision aid and hs-cTnI alone (using the limit of quantification cut-off, 3 ng/L) was evaluated by calculating sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV)., RESULTS: Of 999 included patients, 132 (13.2%) had AMI. C-statistics were 0.96 for T-MACS, 0.78 for HEART and 0.69 for TIMI. The sensitivities of T-MACS, HEART, TIMI, EDACS and hs-cTnI <3 ng/L for AMI were 99.2% (95% CI 95.7% to 100.0%), 91.8% (85.0% to 96.2%), 97.5% (92.9% to 99.5%), 96.2% (92.2% to 99.4%) and 99.2% (95.9% to 100.0%), respectively. The respective strategies would have ruled out 46.5%, 34.9%, 19.4%, 48.3% and 28.8% patients. PPVs for the decision aids that identify 'high-risk' patients were 80.4% (T-MACS), 51.9% (TIMI) and 37.2% (HEART)., CONCLUSIONS: In this study, T-MACS could rule out AMI in 46.5% patients with 99.2% sensitivity.

We aimed to evaluate the correlation between cardiovascular disease and serum homocysteine levels.., METHODS: We performed a case control analysis of 212 patients, either for cardiovascular risk stratification or for invasive diagnostics and treatment of cardiovascular ischemic disease (CAD). Patients were divided into 4 groups: Group 1. Patients with low risk for CAD, with no symptoms of CAD and total of 10 years risk <10%. Group 2. High-risk patients with no symptoms of CAD, but 10 years total CAD risk of >20%. Group 3. Patients with symptomatic CAD, where angiography was performed and >50% occlusion of at least one coronary vessel was found. Group 4. Patients with carotid artery disease and documented CAD., RESULTS: Group 1 consists of 56 subjects, of whom 33 (60%) males and 22 (40%) females. Their mean age was 52.18+/-8.07 years and their average CAD risk was 5. Group 2 included 60 patients, with average CAD risk of 23.73. There was a statistically significant difference between plasma homocysteine levels between the control and high CAD risk group, as well as between those with CAD and both CAD and CARD (p=0.001). In the high-risk subjects group, the level of homocysteine correlates albeit weak with the total CAD risk (p=0.04). Homocysteine levels correlate with the WBC count (p=0.02). In the subgroup of smokers with high CAD risk, homocysteine correlates with age, total CAD risk, total cholesterol, BUN (define BUN) and creatinine. Group 3 consisted of 49 subjects with manifested and angiographically proven CAD, out of whom 80% were males and 20% females, mean age 56.06+/-9.7 years, with average 2 coronary vessels affected. There were significantly higher homocysteine plasma levels between the control group and the group with manifested CAD (p=0.008). There is no significant difference of homocysteine plasma levels between the high risk group and the group with manifested coronary artery disease (15.03mol/l vs. 16.38mol/l). In this group, plasma levels of homocysteine correlate only with the highest level of vessel stenosis (>95%) with (p=0.04). The study population in group 4 showed a mean of IMT 0.9 +..09 mm and mean Hcy plasma levels of 21 + 11 micromol/L. From the evaluated patients with CAD, 82.9% of patients had elevated level of Hcy. From those, one showed elevated Hcy, 79.4 % had hypertension, 58.9 % had hyperlipidemia, 28.2% had diabetes mellitus as additional risk factors for atherosclerosis. 76.9 % of the patients had increased intima-media thickness; in 58.9 % plaques were detected, while 23 % of the patients had significant stenosis: 10.2 % with intermediate-grade stenosis (50-69%) and 12.8 % with high-grade stenosis (70-99 %). 17.1 % of the patients had normal level of Hcy, and in those ones 62.5 % only had increased IMT. We found linear correlation between IMT and HCy levels (r 0.7, p 0.05). Case control analysis showed significant higher level of Hcy in the group with CAD and carotid artery disease vs. CAD group (p 0.001)., CONCLUSION: High plasma homocysteine concentrations are associated with high risk for vascular disease and consequently CAD itself and carotid artery disease, as well, proving its likely role in the development of atherosclerosis on inflammatory and metabolic levels.","Authors":"Bosevski, Marijan; Zlatanovikj, Nenad; Petkoska, Danica; Gjorgievski, Atanas; Lazarova, Emilija; Stojanovska, Lily","Publisher":"Prilozi (Makedonska akademija na naukite i umetnostite.

Identifying clinical features associated with early recurrence may guide focused management. Method(s): Using logistic regression applied to the data of the Platelet Oriented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischemic Stroke (POINT) trial, we evaluated what baseline clinical factors predict outcome events occurring within 7 days of randomization. Result(s): In the POINT trial, 181 subjects (3.7%) had early recurrence, defined as primary outcome events within 7 days of trial entry, whereas only 100 outcome events occurred over the remainder of the 90 day trial. Protective effects of dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel plus aspirin were seen only as a reduction in these early recurrences, without any impact on later events. In univariate analysis, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, serum glucose, initial carotid imaging results, study cohort (minor stroke or TIA), and treatment assignment were significantly associated with early recurrence. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified a number of factors with significant independent associations with early recurrence, including carotid stenosis or occlusion (Odds Ratio [OR] 2.77; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.78-4.31), cohort (minor stroke versus TIA) (OR 1.86; 95% CI 1.33-2.58), race (OR 1.57; 95% CI 1.10-2.25), baseline statin use (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.49-0.95), systolic blood pressure (OR 1.10; 95% CI 1.03-1.18), serum glucose (OR 1.03; 95% CI 1.01-1.05), and age (OR 1.02; 95% CI 1.00-1.03). Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analysis showed a 70% accuracy of the resulting logistic model in predicting early recurrence. Conclusion(s): Early recurrence is high, and is concentrated in the first 7 days, in patients with minor stroke or TIA. A number of baseline clinical factors, including carotid disease, presentation with minor stroke rather than TIA, race, absence of statin usage, systolic blood pressure, and serum glucose, are independently associated with early event recurrence in the POINT trial population.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s).","Authors":"Bourand, N.; Brorson, J.

Although powerful in clinical setting, search for new markers is warranted as early diagnosis of MI is associated with improved outcomes. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) attracted considerable interest as new blood biomarkers. A training cohort used for diagnostic modelling included 30 patients with STEMI, 38 with stable angina (SA) and 30 matched-controls. Extracellular vesicle concentration was assessed by nanoparticle tracking analysis. Extracellular vesicle surface-epitopes were measured by flow cytometry. Diagnostic models were developed using machine learning algorithms and validated on an independent cohort of 80 patients. Serum EV concentration from STEMI patients was increased as compared to controls and SA. EV levels of CD62P, CD42a, CD41b, CD31 and CD40 increased in STEMI, and to a lesser extent in SA patients. An aggregate marker including EV concentration and CD62P/CD42a levels achieved non-inferiority to troponin, discriminating STEMI from controls (AUC = 0.969). A random forest model based on EV biomarkers discriminated the two groups with 100% accuracy. EV markers and RF model confirmed high diagnostic performance at validation. In conclusion, patients with acute MI or SA exhibit characteristic EV biomarker profiles. EV biomarkers hold great potential as early markers for the management of patients with MI.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

We aimed to determine whether iodine concentration within contrast-stained parenchyma compared with an internal reference in the superior sagittal sinus on dual-energy CT could predict subsequent intracerebral hemorrhage., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-one patients with small infarct cores (ASPECTS >= 7) and good endovascular recanalization (modified TICI 2b or 3) for anterior circulation large-vessel occlusion were included. Brain parenchymal iodine concentration as per dual-energy CT and the percentage of contrast staining relative to the superior sagittal sinus were recorded and correlated with the development of intracerebral hemorrhage using Mann-Whitney U and Fisher exact tests., RESULTS: Forty-three of 71 patients had parenchymal hyperdensity on initial dual-energy CT. The median relative iodine concentration compared with the superior sagittal sinus was significantly higher in those with subsequent intracerebral hemorrhage (137.9% versus 109.2%, P = .007). By means of receiver operating characteristic analysis, a cutoff value of 100% (iodine concentration relative to the superior sagittal sinus) enabled identification of patients going on to develop intracerebral hemorrhage with 94.75% sensitivity, 43.4% specificity, and a likelihood ratio of 1.71., CONCLUSIONS: Within our cohort of patients, the relative percentage of iodine concentration at dual-energy CT compared with the superior sagittal sinus was a reliable predictor of intracerebral hemorrhage development and may be a useful imaging biomarker for risk stratification after endovascular treatment.

Concomitance with AAA in patients with PAD is not rare but is easily overlooked in the clinical situation, though management strategies are altered totally. This study aims to investigate diagnostic biomarkers for the prediction of AAA in patients with PAD. Method(s): A total of 684 patients diagnosed with AAA and/or PAD were enrolled and analyzed retrospectively. Each patient with PAD and AAA was gender and age-matched. Demographic data, medical history, and serum laboratory test profiles were obtained. Statistical analysis was performed to determine diagnostic biomarkers of AAA in patients with PAD. Result(s): Firstly, 320 patients with PAD-only and 320 patients with AAA-only were compared. Levels of bilirubin and D-Dimer were decreased, while the incidence of diabetes mellitus, levels of fibrinogen, and platelet count were increased significantly in patients with PAD-only compared with those in patients with AAA-only (P < 0.001). Next, 364 patients with PAD (44 patients with AAA) and 364 patients with AAA (44 patients with PAD) were compared. Multivariate logistic regression analysis confirmed the differential distribution of bilirubin, D-dimer, fibrinogen, and platelet count between patients with AAA and patients with PAD (P < 0.05). Receiver operator curves (ROC) showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, D-dimer, fibrinogen, and platelet count was 0.6113, 0.5849, 0.7034, 0.6473, and 0.6785, respectively. Finally, to further validate the predictive efficacy of mentioned markers, a multivariable logistics regression analysis was performed between the PAD only group and the PAD with AAA group. The results suggested increased levels of D-dimer in the PAD with AAA group compared to the PAD only group (OR: 2.630, 95% CI:1.639-4.221; P < 0.001). In particular, the Youden index suggested that the cut-off value of D-dimer for predicting AAA in patients with PAD was 0.675 mg/L with a sensitivity of 76.9% and a specificity of 84.9% (AUC = 0.8673; 95% CI, 0.8106-0.9240, P < 0.001). In all 364 patients with PAD, 41.46% patients were diagnosed AAA when D-dimer is >0.675 mg/L, while only 3.55% patients were diagnosed AAA when D-dimer <= 0.675 mg/L. Conclusion(s): PAD and AAA exert different clinical and serum profiles; D-dimer (>0.675 mg/L) is a reliable biomarker for the prediction of AAA in patients with PAD.Copyright © 2022 Cai, Pan, Xu, Liu, Wang, Wu, Yang, Huang and Wang.","Authors":"Cai, H.; Pan, B.; Xu, J.; Liu, S.; Wang, L.; Wu, K.; Yang, P.; Huang, J.; Wang, W.","Publisher":"Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine","Issue":"Not Available","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fcvm.2022.890228","Pages":"890228","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"D-dimer (>0.675 mg/L)"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":4,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":18,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":25,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":37,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":423,"Title":"Plasma microrna expression profile for reduced ejection fraction in dilated cardiomyopathy","Year":2021,"Country":"","Abstract":"The left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) is key to prognosis in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Circulating microRNAs have emerged as reliable biomarkers for heart diseases, included DCM. Clinicians need improved tools for greater clarification of DCM EF categorization, to identify high-risk patients. Thus, we investigated whether microRNA profiles can categorize DCM patients based on their EF. 179-differentially expressed circulating microRNAs were screened in two groups: (1) non-idiopathic DCM; (2) idiopathic DCM. Then, 26 microRNAs were identified and validated in the plasma of ischemic-DCM (n = 60), idiopathic-DCM (n = 55) and healthy individuals (n = 44). We identified fourteen microRNAs associated with echocardiographic variables that differentiated idiopathic DCM according to the EF degree. A predictive model of a three-microRNA (miR-130b-3p, miR-150-5p and miR-210-3p) combined with clinical variables (left bundle branch block, left ventricle end-systolic dimension, lower systolic blood pressure and smoking habit) was obtained for idiopathic DCM with a severely reduced-EF. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis supported the discriminative potential of the diagnosis. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that miR-150-5p and miR-210-3p target genes might interact with each other with a high connectivity degree. In conclusion, our results revealed a three-microRNA signature combined with clinical variables that highly discriminate idiopathic DCM categorization. This is a potential novel prognostic biomarker with high clinical value.","Authors":"Calderon-Dominguez, Maria; Belmonte, Thalia; Quezada-Feijoo, Maribel; Ramos, Monica; Calderon-Dominguez, Juan; Campuzano, Oscar; Mangas, Alipio; Toro, Rocio","Publisher":"Scientific reports","Issue":"1","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-87086-1","Pages":"7517","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"miR-130b-3p & miR-150-5p & miR-210-3p &  left bundle branch block (LBBB) & left ventricle end-systolic dimension (LVESD)"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":6,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":24,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":31,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":429,"Title":"Development of a convolutional neural network to detect abdominal aortic aneurysms","Year":2022,"Country":"","Abstract":"Objective: We sought to train a foundational convolutional neural network (CNN) for screening computed tomography (CT) angiography (CTA) scans for the presence of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) for future predictive modeling and other artificial intelligence applications. Method(s): From January 2015 to January 2020, a HIPAA (Health Insurance and Accountability Act)-compliant, institutional review board-approved, retrospective clinical study analyzed contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic CTA scans from 200 patients with infrarenal AAAs and 200 propensity-matched control patients with non-aneurysmal infrarenal abdominal aortas. A CNN was trained to binary classification on the input. For model improvement and testing, transfer learning using the ImageNet database was applied to the VGG-16 base model. The image dataset was randomized to sets of 60%, 10%, and 30% for model training, validation, and testing, respectively. A stochastic gradient descent was used for optimization. The models were assessed by testing validation accuracy and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Result(s): Preliminary data demonstrated a nonrandom pattern of accuracy and detectability. Iterations (<=10) of the model characteristics generated a final custom CNN model reporting an accuracy of 99.1% and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.99. Misjudgments were analyzed through review of the heat maps generated via gradient weighted class activation mapping overlaid on the original CT images. The greatest misjudgments were seen in small aneurysms (<3.3 cm) with mural thrombus. Conclusion(s): Preliminary data from a CNN model have shown that the model can accurately screen and identify CTA findings of infrarenal AAAs. This model serves as a proof-of-concept to proceed with potential future directions to include expansion to predictive modeling and other artificial intelligence-based applications.Copyright © 2022","Authors":"Camara, J.

The aim of the study was to find the potential roles of B-Type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and imaging markers on distinguishing cardioembolic (CE) stroke from non-CE stroke, so as to provide useful information for making individualized endovascular treatment (EVT) plan for the patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Methods. The patients with unilateral anterior circulation large vessel occlusion who underwent EVT between March 2016 and December 2021 were analyzed in this study, retrospectively. The risk factors, laboratory test indicators, imaging parameters, and other factors were compared between the CE group and non-CE group. Logistic regression was used to analyze the risk factors of CE stroke. ROC curves were used to assess the values of different parameters on distinguishing CE stroke from non-CE stroke. The relationships between BNP and imaging parameters were assessed using the Spearman correlation analysis. Results. 160 patients were enrolled in the study and divided into the CE group (n=66) and non-CE group (n=94). BNP (odds ratio OR=1.004; 95% CI, 1.001-1.009; p=0.038), MMR (OR=0.736; 95% CI, 0.573-0.945; p=0.016), NIHSS (OR=1.150; 95% CI, 1.022-1.294; p=0.020), and AF (OR=556.968; 95% CI, 51.739-5995.765; p<0.001) were the independent predictive factors of CE stroke. The area under the curve (AUC) of BNP and mismatch ratio (MMR) were 0.846 (95% CI (0.780-0.898), p<0.001) and 0.636 (95% CI (0.633-0.779), p<0.001), respectively. The cut-off value of BNP was 249.23 pg/mL with the sensitivity of 74.24% and the specificity of 82.98%. BNP combined with MMR improved the predictive value for CE stroke. The AUC of the combination was 0.858 with the sensitivity of 84.85% and the specificity of 73.40%. BNP was correlated with 4D CTA collateral score, MMR, clot burden score, final infarct volume, infarct core volume, and ischemic penumbra volume (all, p<0.05). Conclusion. BNP on admission combined with MMR is valuable for the risk prediction of CE stroke, which will promote the further screening of the high-risk patients with CE stroke and provide more diagnostic information for clinicians.Copyright © 2022 Ruoyao Cao et al.","Authors":"Cao, R.; Jiang, Y.; Li, L.; Lu, Y.; Wang, J.; Yu, K.; Chen, M.; Chen, J.","Publisher":"Disease Markers","Issue":"Not Available","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/3327967","Pages":"3327967","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) & mismatch ratio calculated using imaging markers"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":3,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":18,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":24,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":436,"Title":"Basilar Artery Dolichosis Increases the Risk of Long-Term Recurrence in Patients With Pontine Infarction: A Prospective Cohort Study","Year":2021,"Country":"","Abstract":"Background and Purpose: Patients with basilar artery (BA) dolichosis are at high risk of acute pontine infarction (API), but the association between BA dolichosis and long-term stroke recurrence has received little attention. We aimed to identify the effect of BA dolichosis on the risk of long-term brainstem infarction recurrence in patients with API. Method(s): In this prospective cohort study, we enrolled 113 patients with API admitted to our department. BA dolichosis was diagnosed by a BA curve length >29.5 mm or bending length (BL) >10 mm on magnetic resonance angiography. The primary outcome was the occurrence of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)-confirmed brainstem infarction. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to detect possible predictors of brainstem infarction recurrence. Result(s): Among 113 patients with API, 39 (34.5%) patients had BA dolichosis, and DWI-confirmed brainstem infarction recurred in 15 (13.3%) patients with a mean follow-up time of 31.2 months; the estimated 5-year incidence of brainstem infarction recurrence was 23.1% in patients with BA dolichosis, which was significantly higher than the incidence of 8.1% in patients without BA dolichosis. Cox proportional hazard analysis showed that age >=65 years (hazard ratio (HR) = 3.341, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.079-10.348, P = 0.036) and BA dolichosis (HR = 3.048, 95% CI: 1.069-8.693, P = 0.037) were significantly associated with a higher risk of brainstem infarction recurrence. In a subgroup analysis stratified by age, the patients aged >=65 years with BA dolichosis had a higher risk of brainstem infarction recurrence (HR = 7.319, 95% CI: 1.525-35.123, P = 0.013). Conclusion(s): This study indicates that BA dolichosis may increase the risk of long-term brainstem infarction recurrence in patients with API, especially in elderly patients, and therefore warrants more attention in clinical practice.Copyright © 2021 Cao, Zhu, Wu, Ni, He, Cui, Ge, Wang, Xu and Xia.","Authors":"Cao, S.; Zhu, X.; Wu, Q.; Ni, X.; He, J.; Cui, P.; Ge, T.; Wang, J.; Xu, W.; Xia, M.","Publisher":"Frontiers in Neurology","Issue":"Not Available","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2021.788145","Pages":"788145","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"basilar artery (BA) dolichosis diagnosed by a BA curve length >29.5 mm or\nbending length (BL) >10 mm"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":8,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":15,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":24,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":25,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":447,"Title":"Traditional and non-traditional risk factors for peripheral artery disease development/progression in patients with type 2 diabetes: the Rio de Janeiro type 2 diabetes cohort study","Year":2021,"Country":"","Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The prognostic importance of non-traditional risk factors for peripheral artery disease (PAD) development/progression is scarcely studied in diabetes. We investigated if carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV) added prognostic information beyond traditional cardiovascular risk markers for PAD outcomes., METHODS: Ankle-brachial index (ABI) was measured at baseline and after a median of 91 months of follow-up in 681 individuals with type 2 diabetes. Multivariate Cox regressions examined the associations between the candidate variables and the outcome. PAD development/progression was defined by a reduction in ABI >= 0.15 (to a level < 0.9) or limb revascularization procedures, lower-extremity amputations or death due to PAD. The improvement in risk discrimination was assessed by increases in C-statistics of the models., RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients developed/progressed PAD: 50 reduced ABI to < 0.9, seven had lower-limb revascularizations, and 20 had amputations or death. Age, male sex, diabetes duration, presence of microvascular complications (peripheral neuropathy and diabetic kidney disease), baseline HbA1c, 24-h systolic BP (SBP) and mean cumulative office SBP and LDL-cholesterol were associated with PAD development/progression in several models. CIMT and cf-PWV were additionally associated with PAD outcomes, and their inclusion further improved risk discrimination (with C-statistic increases between 0.025 and 0.030). The inclusion of ambulatory 24-h SBP, instead of office SBP, also improved PAD risk discrimination., CONCLUSIONS: Increased CIMT and aortic stiffness are associated with greater risks of developing/progressing PAD, beyond traditional risk factors, in type 2 diabetes.","Authors":"Cardoso, Claudia R.

Prior randomized studies had focused mainly on primary prevention. Whether Vit-D protects against ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction recurrence among subjects with prior ischemic insults was unknown. Here, we dissected through Mendelian randomization any effect of Vit-D on the secondary prevention of recurrent ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction., METHODS: Based on a genetic risk score for Vit-D constructed from a derivation cohort sample (n=5331, 45% Vit-D deficient, 89% genotyped) via high-throughput exome-chip screening of 12 prior genome-wide association study-identified genetic variants of Vit-D mechanistic pathways (rs2060793, rs4588, and rs7041; F statistic, 73; P<0.001), we performed a focused analysis on prospective recurrence of myocardial infarction (MI) and ischemic stroke in an independent subsample with established ischemic disease (n=441, all with prior first ischemic event; follow-up duration, 41.6+/-14.3 years) under a 2-sample, individual-data, prospective Mendelian randomization approach., RESULTS: In the ischemic disease subsample, 11.1% (n=49/441) had developed recurrent ischemic stroke or MI and 13.3% (n=58/441) had developed recurrent or de novo ischemic stroke/MI. Kaplan-Meier analyses showed that genetic risk score predicted improved event-free survival from recurrent ischemic stroke or MI (log-rank, 13.0; P=0.001). Cox regression revealed that genetic risk score independently predicted reduced risk of recurrent ischemic stroke or MI combined (hazards ratio, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.48-0.81]; P<0.001), after adjusted for potential confounders. Mendelian randomization supported that Vit-D is causally protective against the primary end points of recurrent ischemic stroke or MI (Wald estimate: odds ratio, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.35-0.81]) and any recurrent or de novo ischemic stroke/MI (odds ratio, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.42-0.91]) and recurrent MI alone (odds ratio, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.30-0.81])., CONCLUSIONS: Genetically predicted lowering in Vit-D level is causal for the recurrence of ischemic vascular events in persons with prior ischemic stroke or MI.","Authors":"Chan, Yap-Hang; Schooling, C.

Increased concentration of plasma CypA in acute cerebral infarction was demonstrated clinically. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic impact between CypA level and outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Admission serum CypA concentrations were detected in 66 acute cerebral infarction patients and in 52 healthy individuals. Inflammatory biomarkers, including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, adhesion molecules, interleukins, and matrix-metalloproteases, were also assessed. We also examined the relationship between plasma biomarkers, blood pressure (BP), pulse pressure, the carotid artery velocity, the prognostic assessment with modified Rankin scale, and stroke recurrence. Plasma CypA concentration was higher on the first day of hospitalization in the high BP stroke group than in normal BP stroke group, which was statistically significant, which was observed even in the third month and sixth month follow-up outpatient periods. For stroke recurrence prediction, there was an important association between the higher (>60) pulse pressure on the seventh day of hospitalization and CypA level on the third month and sixth month follow-up outpatient periods. Our study revealed higher circulating serum levels of CypA in the hypertensive stroke group than in the non-hypertensive stroke group. We expect that elevated plasma CypA level and raised pulse pressure during hospitalization to become valuable biomarkers in predicting stroke recurrence in the sixth month assessment of acute cerebral infarction.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Timely conclusion permits clinicians to risk stratify their patients and select suitable treatment. Biomarkers have been utilized to help with timely decision, whereas an expanding number of novel markers have been recognized to predict result taking after an acute myocardial infarction or acute coronary disorder. This may encourage tailoring of appropriate treatment to high-risk patients. This survey focuses on an assortment of promising biomarkers which give symptomatic and prognostic data. Objective(s): To compare the early demonstrative efficiency of the cardiac troponin I (cTn-I) level with that of the cardiac troponin T (cTn-T) level, as well as the creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB, and myoglobin levels, for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in patients without an initially diagnostic ECG presenting to the Emergency department within 24 hours of the onset of their symptoms. Material and Methods Study design: Prospective Observational Cohort Settings: Punjab Institute of Cardiology Duration: Six months i.e. 1st January 2020 to 30th June 2020 Data Collection procedure: A planned, observational, cohort study was performed including chest pain patients admitted to territory care hospital. Members were sequential consenting through Emergency department with chest pain and age more than 30 years. Exclusion included having symptoms >24 hours, failure to total information collection, receipt of CPR, and ST-segment elevation on the starting ECG. Estimations included levels of Trop-I, Trop- T, CK, CK-MB, and myoglobin at the time of introduction and 1, 2, 6, and 12-24 hours after presentation as well as showing ECG and clinical follow-up. The collected data was analyzed by using SPSS version 23. Result(s): 140 included for study out of the 200 patients, 21 (14%) were analyzed as having acute myocardial infarction after diagnostic ECG testing. The sensitivities of all 5 biochemical markers for acute myocardial infarction were poor at the time of emergency department induction. The sensitivity of Trop-T was essentially superior to that of Trop-I over the starting 2 hours (3.2-33.1), but both markers' sensitivities were low (<60%) during this time outline. The Trop-I was significantly more particular for acute myocardial infarction than was the Trop-T, but not essentially better than CK-MB or myoglobin. Likelihood proportion analysis appeared that the biochemical markers with the most elevated positive ratios for acute myocardial infarction amid the primary 2 hours taking after emergency department admission were myoglobin and CK-MB. From 6 through 24 hours, the positive probability proportions for Trop I, CK-MB, and myoglobin were predominant to those of CK and Trop-T. Conclusion(s): Trop-I, CK-MB, and myoglobin are essentially more particular for acute myocardial infarction than are CK and Trop-T. Myoglobin is the biochemical marker having the most elevated combination of sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value for acute myocardial infarction inside 2 hours of emergency department induction. Not one or the other Trop-I nor Trop-T offers significant advantages over myoglobin and CK-MB within the early less than 2 hours starting screening for acute myocardial infarction. The cardiac troponins are of advantage in recognizing acute myocardial infarction greater than 6 hours after presentation.Copyright © 2021 Lahore Medical And Dental College.

The work up typically involves neuroimaging of the brain and blood vessels to determine etiology. However, extensive testing may be unnecessary for presumed hypertensive hemorrhages, and instead prolong hospital stay and increase costs. This study evaluates the predictive utility of hemorrhage location on the non-contrast head CT in determining hypertensive ICH. Patients presenting with non-traumatic ICH between March 2014 and June 2019 were prospectively enrolled. Hemorrhage etiology was determined based on previously defined criteria. Chi square and Student's t tests were used to determine the association between patient demographics, ICH severity, neuroimaging characteristics, and medical variables, with hypertensive etiology. Multivariable regression models and an ROC analysis determined utility of CT to accurately diagnose hypertensive ICH. Data on 380 patients with ICH were collected; 42% were determined to be hypertensive. Along with deep location on CT, black race, history of hypertension, renal disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, and higher admission blood pressure were significantly associated with hypertensive etiology, while atrial fibrillation and anticoagulation were associated with non-hypertensive etiologies. Deep location alone resulted in an area under the curve of 0.726. When history of hypertension was added, this improved to 0.771. Additional variables did not further improve the model's predictability. Hypertensive ICH is associated with several predictive factors. Using deep location and history of hypertension alone correctly identifies the majority of hypertensive ICH without additional work-up. This model may result in more efficient diagnostic testing without sacrificing patient care. Copyright © 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

The SVS originates from the local magnetic susceptibility effect; thus, the susceptibility value of thrombi may provide useful information in discriminating stroke etiology. We aim to utilize quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) to assess thrombus's susceptibility value in acute ischemic stroke patients and explore the relationship of thrombus susceptibility with cardioembolic stroke. Method(s): From 2018 to 2020, 132 consecutive acute ischemic stroke patients with middle cerebral artery occlusion were recruited within 48 hours of onset. All patients underwent a three-dimensional multi-echo SWI scan using a 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging scanner. The SVS presence and the diameter of the SVS-related hypointense signal were assessed on SWI. QSM was applied to compute the susceptibility value of the thrombus. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) methodology was used to define the optimal cutoff value of the susceptibility in QSM and the diameter on SWI for predicting cardioembolic stroke. Result(s): The SVS was identified in 93 (70.5%) patients with symptomatic middle cerebral artery occlusion and was significantly associated with cardioembolism. The hyperintense signal on QSM in the corresponding middle cerebral artery occlusion was present in 116 (87.9%) patients. ROC analysis indicated that thrombus susceptibility had a greater area under the curve than that of the SVS diameter (0.88 vs. 0.70, P<0.001) and that the optimal cutoff value of thrombus susceptibility for cardioembolism was 0.35 ppm. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that thrombus susceptibility (>=0.35 ppm) was an independent predictor of cardioembolic stroke (odds ratio =20.75; 95% CI, 7.19-59.87; P<0.001), with sensitivity, specificity, a positive predictive value, and a negative predictive value of 85.2%, 80.8%, 75.4%, and 88.7%, respectively, while the SVS presence showed sensitivity, specificity, a positive predictive value, and a negative predictive value of 90.7%, 43.6%, 87.2%, and 52.7%, respectively. Conclusion(s): Thrombus susceptibility provides superior diagnostic performance over the SVS for discriminating between cardioembolism and other stroke subtypes. Quantitative susceptibility measurements of thrombi may help predict cardioembolic stroke in patients with acute middle cerebral artery occlusion.Copyright © Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery.

Venous blood was collected 4 hours, 1 day, 4 days and 7 days after treatment. The levels of copeptin, BNP and cTnT in the serum of the patients were measured. The same age was randomly selected for physical examination in the same period at our hospital. Thirty healthy elderly people served as a control group. Copeptin, BNP and cTnT levels were detected and compared in each group. An ROC curve was drawn to evaluate the diagnostic value of copeptin, BNP and cTnT levels for elderly patients with acute myocardial infarction. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyse the independent risk factors of acute myocardial infarction. Result(s): The levels of copeptin, BNP and cTnT in the serum of the study group were significantly higher than those of the control group at each time point (P0.05 or 0.01). The levels of copeptin and BNP in the serum of the study group began to rise after the onset of acute myocardial infarction, reached the highest level on day 1, then slowly decreased to the lowest level at day 7, with significant differences at each time point (P0.05 or 0.01). The cTnT level of acute myocardial infarction in the study group increased rapidly to the highest level at 4h, then decreased slowly to the lowest level day 7, with a significant difference at each time point (P0.05 or 0.01).

Notably, the detection of copeptin, BNP and CTnT levels may play an important role in the early diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in the elderly.Copyright © 2020 A. CARBONE Editore.

However, genetic tests for FH are not always necessary in the current diagnostic criteria of FH, which might lead to underestimation of the prevalence of FH and a lack of awareness of FH-associated CAD and AMI. We aimed to explore the prevalence of genetically defined FH in the hospital-based population and to determine the impact of FH risk variants on CAD and AMI. Method(s): The study participants were recruited between June 24, 2019 and May 12, 2021, at a medical center in Taiwan, in cooperation with the Taiwan Precision Medicine Initiative (TPMI) project. The prevalence of FH was calculated and the effects of FH pathogenic variants on CAD and AMI were analyzed by logistic regression models and shown as ORs and 95% CI. Result(s): The prevalence of genetically defined FH was 1.13% in the hospital-based population in Taiwan. Highest LDL and total cholesterol levels were observed in patients with LDLR rs28942084 (LDL 219.4+/-55.2; total cholesterol 295.8+/-55.4). There was an approximately 4-fold increased risk of hyperlipidemia in subjects with the LDLR rs769446356 polymorphism (OR, 4.42; 95% CI, 1.92-10.19) and AMI in individuals with the LDLR rs730882109 polymorphism (OR, 3.79; 95% CI, 2.26-6.35), and a 2-fold increased risk of CAD in those with the LDLR rs749038326 polymorphism (OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.31-3.50), compared with the groups without pathogenic variants of FH. Conclusion(s): The prevalence of genetically defined FH was 1.13% in the hospital-based population in Taiwan, which was higher than the rate observed in individuals with clinically defined FH. The risk of CAD and AMI was increased to varying degrees in subjects with different FH risk alleles. Close monitoring and risk stratification strategy are essential in high-risk patients with FH risk alleles to facilitate early detection and treatments.Copyright © 2022 Chen, Chen, Chen, Hsiao, Wei, Chuang, Lin and Lin.","Authors":"Chen, Y.

AMI is one of the most common diseases in European countries and over 1.5 million AMI patients die of it in the United States annually. A collection of studies proposed that certain micro-RNAs play crucial roles in the onset and development of AMI., METHODS: Ninety-four AMI patients and 83 non-AMI healthy controls were recruited from Zhongda Hospital, Southeast University between July 2015 and September 2017. Serum samples were collected at admission and the expression of miR-142 was detected using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays., RESULTS: miR-142 expression was markedly elevated in serum samples of AMI patients compared with the 83 non-AMI healthy controls. miR-142 expression was positively correlated with creatine kinase-KB (CK-MB; r = 0.6731, p = 0.0021) and troponin (r = 0.7138, p = 0.0013). The area under the curve (AUC) of miR-142, CK-MB, and troponin for the diagnosis of AMI were 0.9185, 0.8172, and 0.8717, respectively. Overall survival analysis implied that high miR-142 expression may predict poor survival (log-rank test, p = 0.0146)., CONCLUSIONS: miR-142 may be a diagnostic and prognostic indicator for AMI, and therefore, it may contribute to AMI clinicopathologic prediction.","Authors":"Chen, Zhongpu; Pan, Xiaodong; Yan, Gaoliang; Sheng, Zulong; Ma, Genshan","Publisher":"Clinical laboratory","Issue":"6","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.7754/Clin.Lab.2019.191019","Pages":"Not Available","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"miRNA-142"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":8,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":24,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":571,"Title":"Study of three novel biomarkers, MR-proADM, midkine, and stromelysin2, and peripheral atherosclerosis in a Chinese Han population: A case-control study","Year":2020,"Country":"","Abstract":"Midregional pro-adrenomedullin (MR-proADM), midkine, and stromelysin2 (ST2) are novel cardiac biomarkers associated with heart failure and atherosclerotic diseases like stable ischemic disease and acute coronary syndrome. The potential association between these three biomarkers and peripheral artery disease (PAD) remains unclear. The aim of this study was to assess the correlation between these three biomarkers and their association with PAD in the Chinese Han population. This study included 224 patients suspected of having coronary artery disease (CAD). All subjects underwent coronary angiography and carotid and subclavian ultrasound assessment for detection of coronary and peripheral atherosclerosis and were divided into two groups according to whether they had PAD or not. Pearson's correlation coefficient r was calculated, and multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to represent the associations of these biomarkers and PAD. The study included 133 patients with PAD and 91 non-PAD controls and these two groups had similar values for age, ST2, hematocrit, hemoglobin, red blood cell counts, creatinine and CAD ratio, smoking, and type 2 diabetes (all p > 0.05). Compared with non-PAD controls, patients with PAD had lower levels of MR-proADM and midkine and higher levels of TC, LDL-C, and fasting blood sugar (FBS) (all p < 0.05). MR-proADM was positively and ST2 negatively correlated with midkine (all p < 0.05). Compared with females, male patients had higher values of MR-proADM (p < 0.05) and similar levels of ST2 and midkine (all p > 0.05). Multivariable regression analysis identified FBS as a risk predictor (OR: 1.163, 95% CI: 1.108-1.401, p = 0.014) and MR-proADM as a protective factor (OR: 0.720, 95% CI: 0.529-0.920, p = 0.037) of PAD.

However, previous studies assessed liver enzymes only once at baseline. We investigated the association between liver enzyme variability and the risk of mortality and cardiovascular outcomes in general population., METHODS: A total of 6 496 271 subjects participating in >=3 health examinations within the previous 5 years including the index year (2009-2010) were included. Variability was measured using variability independent of the mean. Cox proportional hazard models adjusting demographic factors, comorbidities, blood pressure, total cholesterol, glomerular filtration rate and baseline liver enzyme level were used., RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 6 years, there were 106 413 deaths (1.6%), 53 385 myocardial infarctions (MI, 0.8%), 65 143 atrial fibrillations (AF, 1.0%) and 50 139 congestive heart failures (CHF, 0.7%). High variability in AST, ALT and GGT was associated with a higher risk for all-cause mortality, MI, AF and CHF. The degree of association was largest for GGT variability. For the highest quartile of GGT variability relative to the lowest quartile, the hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) were 1.32 (1.28-1.35) for all-cause mortality, 1.16 (1.11-1.20) for MI, 1.28 (1.18-1.38) for AF and 1.25 (1.20-1.30) for CHF. These findings were consistent regardless of alcohol consumption, body mass index and degree of fatty liver. Sensitivity analysis also revealed similar results., CONCLUSIONS: Higher visit-to-visit variability of liver enzymes was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events.

Serum PCSK9 levels in patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may predict long-term outcomes. PCSK9 levels were measured in 749 consecutive patients with coronary artery disease undergoing PCI. These patients were classified into 2 groups according to their serum levels of PCSK9. The primary end point was a composite of the major adverse cardiac events (MACE), including cardiac death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and any revascularization. The median PCSK9 level was 302.82 ng/ml. During a median follow-up of 28.4 months, a total of 38 (5.1%) MACE was recorded, and 50 (6.7%) patients died from any cause. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that compared with a lower serum PCSK9 level, a higher serum PCSK9 level was independently associated with a higher rate of MACE (adjusted hazard ratio 2.290, 95% confidence interval 1.040 to 5.045, p = 0.040) and all-cause death (adjusted hazard ratio 2.511, 95% confidence interval 1.220 to 5.167, p = 0.026).

We conducted a prospective nested case-control study in northern Sweden in individuals who developed STEMI (N = 50) and NSTEMI (N = 50) within 5 years and individually matched controls (N = 100). Fasted plasma samples were subjected to multiplatform mass spectrometrybased metabolomics and multiplex protein analyses. Multivariate analyses were used to elucidate infarction-specific metabolite and protein risk profiles associated with future incident STEMI and NSTEMI.We found that altered lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) to lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) ratio predicted STEMI and NSTEMI events in different ways. In STEMI, lysophospholipids (mainly LPEs) were lower, whereas in NSTEMI, lysophospholipids (mainly LPEs) were higher. We found a similar response for all detected lysophospholipids but significant alterations only for those containing linoleic acid (C18:2, p < 0.05). Patients with STEMI had higher secretoglobin family 3A member 2 and tartrate-resistant acid phosphate type 5 and lower platelet-derived growth factor subunit A, which are proteins associated with atherosclerosis severity and plaque development mediated via altered phospholipid metabolism. In contrast, patients with NSTEMI had higher levels of proteins associated with inflammation and macrophage activation, including interleukin 6, C-reactive protein, chemerin, and cathepsin X and D. The STEMI risk marker profile includes factors closely related to the development of unstable plaque, including a higher LPC:LPE ratio, whereas NSTEMI is characterized by a lower LPC:LPE ratio and increased inflammation.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

A total of 255 consecutive patients who were referred for invasive coronary angiography due to suspected stable angina pectoris were prospectively included in the study. B-mode ultrasonography was used to determine AAIMT before coronary angiography. Coronary artery disease severity was assessed with the SYNTAX score (SS). A history of hypertension, age, dyslipidemia, and higher AAIMT (odds ratio: 2.570; 95%CI 1.831-3.608; P < .001) were independent predictors of intermediate or high SS. An AAIMT <1.3 mm had a negative predictive value of 98% for the presence of intermediate or high SS and 83% for obstructive CAD. In conclusion, AAIMT showed a significant and independent predictive value for intermediate or high SS.

These biomarkers should rapidly analyze, have high specificity for brain damage, and be available in the emergency settings for early diagnosis and exclusion of other conditions that mimic acute ischemic stroke. Soluble tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis, a protein involved in the regulation of several biological functions, could be a potential acute ischemic stroke biomarker., Aims: To investigate the diagnostic value of soluble tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis in patients with acute ischemic stroke and examine the relationship between ischemic area volume determined at diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and soluble tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis., Study Design: A prospective, case-control study., Methods: This case-control prospective study included 36 patients with acute ischemic stroke and 36 healthy volunteers. Information on age, sex, presence of chronic disease, neurological examination findings, times of presentation to the emergency department after acute ischemic stroke, soluble tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis levels, ischemic area volumes at diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, and 6-month mortality rates after stroke were recorded.

EAT volume and density were quantified using a fully automated deep learning method. ML extreme gradient boosting was trained using clinical co-variates, plasma lipid panel measurements, risk factors, CAC, aortic calcium, and automated EAT measures, and validated using repeated 10-fold cross validation. During mean follow-up of 14.5 +/- 2 years, 76 events of MI and/or cardiac death occurred. ML obtained a significantly higher AUC than atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk and CAC score for predicting events (ML: 0.82; ASCVD: 0.77; CAC: 0.77, P < 0.05 for all). Subjects with a higher ML score (by Youden's index) had high hazard of suffering events (HR: 10.38, P < 0.001); the relationships persisted in multivariable analysis including ASCVD-risk and CAC measures (HR: 2.94, P = 0.005). Age, ASCVD-risk, and CAC were prognostically important for both genders. Systolic blood pressure was more important than cholesterol in women, and the opposite in men. Conclusions In this prospective study, machine learning used to integrate clinical and quantitative imaging-based variables significantly improves prediction of MI and cardiac death compared with standard clinical risk assessment.

Method(s): We included asymptomatic patients with diabetes and no coronary history, who had undergone both a stress a myocardial scintigraphy to diagnose myocardial ischemia, and a computed tomography to measure their coronary artery calcium (CAC) score. EAT volume was retrospectively measured from computed tomography imaging. Determinants of EAT volume and asymptomatic myocardial ischemia were evaluated. Result(s): The study population comprised 274 individuals, including 153 men. Mean (+/- standard deviation) age was 62 +/- 9 years, and 243, 23 and 8 had type 2, type 1, or another type of diabetes, respectively. Mean body mass index was 30 +/- 6 kg/m2, and mean EAT volume 96 +/- 36 cm3. Myocardial ischemia was detected in 32 patients (11.7%). EAT volume was positively correlated with age, body mass index and triglyceridemia, but negatively correlated with HbA1c, HDL- and LDL-cholesterol levels. Furthermore, EAT volume was lower in people with retinopathy, but higher in men, in current smokers, in patients with nephropathy, those with a CAC score > 100 Agatston units, and finally in individuals with myocardial ischemia (110 +/- 37 cm3 vs 94 +/- 37 cm3 in those without myocardial ischemia, p < 0.05). The association between EAT volume and myocardial ischemia remained significant after adjustment for gender, diabetes duration, peripheral macrovascular disease and CAC score. We also found that area under the ROC curve analysis showed that EAT volume (AROC: 0.771 [95% confidence interval 0.683-0.858]) did not provide improved discrimination of myocardial ischemia over the following classic factors: gender, diabetes duration, peripheral macrovascular disease, retinopathy, nephropathy, smoking, atherogenic dyslipidemia, and CAC score (AROC 0.773 [0.683-0.862]). Conclusion(s): EAT may play a role in coronary atherosclerosis and coronary circulation in patients with diabetes. However, considering EAT volume is not a better marker for discriminating the risk of asymptomatic myocardial ischemia than classic clinical data.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).","Authors":"Cosson, E.; Nguyen, M.

This study was aimed to determine the effect of two APOB gene variants in the risk of developing early-onset coronary artery disease (EO-CAD) in a Spanish population. The association of these polymorphisms with hypercholesterolemia was also analysed., METHODS AND RESULTS: The study involved a total of 889 healthy population controls (397 male) and 790 EO-CAD cases (636 male; EO-CAD was defined as male <60 years and women <65 years). All the patients had at least one vessel with angiography documented atherosclerotic lesion. Patients and controls were genotyped for the APOB variants rs1801701 A/G (p.R3638Q) and rs1367117 C/T (p.T98I). Allele and genotype frequencies were compared between the groups (patients vs. controls, hyper-vs. normo-cholesterolemia) by logistic regression. The rs1801701 was significantly associated with EO-CAD in male (OR = 1.44, 95%CI = 1.05-1.99) and female (OR = 2.22, 95%CI = 1.58-3.14). This SNP was significantly associated with hypercholesterolemia in female, with a trend in male. The association with EO-CAD was independent of hypercholesterolemia (multiple logistic regression)., CONCLUSION: A common APOB polymorphism (rs1801701) was an independent risk factor for EO-CAD in our population. The risk-effect was more significant in female than in male.

However, there are rare studies on the prediction of MACCE in patients with ACS using lipoprotein a [Lp(a)] combined with fibrinogen. The aim of this study was to analyze the predictive value of Lp(a) combined with fibrinogen for the long-term prognosis of patients with ACS. Method(s): 804 patients with ACS admitted to 11 tertiary general hospitals in Chengdu from January 2017 to June 2019 were included in the study. According to the Lp(a) 300 mg/L, patients were assigned to the non-high Lp(a) group and high Lp(a) group. Patients were assigned to the non-high or high fibrinogen groups using the fibrinogen level of 3.08 g/L. Subsequently, patients were divided into group A, B, or C by Lp(a) combined with fibrinogen. The study endpoints were MACCE, including all-cause death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and revascularization. The incidences of MACCE among groups were compared. Lp(a), fibrinogen, Lp(a) combined with fibrinogen classifications were each added into the basic model to construct three new models. The C-index, net reclassification index (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) of the three new models were then compared. Result(s): The median follow-up was 16 months. During follow-up, the cumulative incidence of MACCE in group C was significantly higher than that measured in group A and B (p < 0.001). The results of the multivariate Cox regression analysis of MACCE showed that Lp(a) >=300 mg/L with fibrinogen >=3.08 g/L was an independent predictor of MACCE. According to the GRACE score and the statistical analyses, the basic model was constructed, which had a C-index of 0.694. The C-index, NRI, and IDI of the new model constructed using the basic model + Lp(a) combined with fibrinogen classification were 0.736, 0.095, and 0.094 respectively. Conclusion(s): Single Lp(a), single fibrinogen and Lp(a) combined with fibrinogen were independent predictors of MACCE in patients with ACS. The predictive value of Lp(a) combined with fibrinogen in patients with ACS was better than that of single Lp(a) and single fibrinogen.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.","Authors":"Cui, C.

The aim of the present cross-sectional study was to identify novel biomarkers associated with PAD. Patients and Methods: Levels of 91 cardiovascular specific proteins in plasma samples were measured by the Proseek Multiplex CVD III96x96 panel from a cohort consisting of 267 65-year-old men recruited from a screening program for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) Levels of protein biomarkers were compared in men with and without PAD (defined as an ankle brachial index of <= 0.9) and their diagnostic potential was calculated by receiver-operating characteristic analysis. Result(s): The prevalence of PAD was 14.2% (38/267). After adjustment for multiple comparisons, levels of the following 11 biomarkers remained significantly higher (p <= 0.0001) in patients with PAD: secretoglobin family 3A member 2, osteoprotegerin, urokinase-type plasminogen activator surface receptor, serum macrophage chemokine ligand 16, matrix metalloproteinase 9, p-selectin, growth differentiation factor 15, elafin, cystatin B, trefoil factor 3, and fatty acid-binding protein 4. Multivariable logistic regression analysis (adjusted for smoking, use of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medication, and metformin) showed that 11 biomarkers were significantly associated with higher risk of PAD with odds ratios ranging from 1.6 to 2.4. Area under curve calculated by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis (diagnostic value) for each protein biomarker ranged from 0.63 to 0.74.

Increased Atrial fat on the left atrium has been discovered to cause Atrial Fibrillation (AF) in most patients. AF can put one's life at risk and eventually lead to death. AF might worsen over time; therefore, it is crucial to have an early diagnosis and treatment. To evaluate the left atrium fat tissue pattern using Radon descriptor-based machine learning. This study developed a bridge between the Radon transform framework and machine learning to distinguish two distinct patterns. Motivated by a Radon descriptor-based machine learning approach, the patches of eight patients from CT images of the heart were used and categorized into \"epicardial fat tissue\" and \"nonfat tissue\" groups. The 10 feature vectors are extracted from each big patch using Radon descriptors and then fed into a traditional machine learning model. The results show that the proposed methodology discriminates between fat tissues and nonfat tissues clearly. KNN has shown the best performance with 96.77% specificity, 98.28% sensitivity, and 97.50% accuracy. To our knowledge, this study is the first attempt to provide a Radon transform-based machine learning method to distinguish between fat tissue and nonfat tissue on the left atrium.

However, its limited availability could entail missing or delayed diagnosis. A reduction of left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LV GLS) by speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) correlates with amount of oedema in acute myocarditis and here may be early detected. Aim was to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic role of 3-layers LV GLS in patients with acute myocarditis. Out of 122 patients with suspected acute myocarditis, a total of 86 consecutive patients with CMRI-confirmed acute myocarditis admitted in two Italian institutions were retrospectively screened. Exclusion criteria were met in 29 patients because of poor acoustic window or missing data. A total of 57 patients were then included. Clinical characteristics, laboratory examinations, transthoracic echocardiography data and STE parameters were collected early after hospitalization. In the study population, mean age was 38.8 +/- 15.6 years, the prevalence of male gender was 90%. On admission, 22 patients (39%) had fever (body temperature > 37.5 degree), mean white blood cell (WBC) count was 10.9 +/- 1.7/10^3 and overall LV ejection fraction was 50.1% +/- 11.2. An epicardial LV GLS < 18% was present in 74% of patients, and a model including at least one of LV GLS < 18% (absolute value), fever and WBC > 10.0/10^3 was able to identify all patients with CMRI-diagnosed acute myocarditis. An epicardial LV GLS < 15.3% (absolute value) at baseline significantly predicted the lack of myocarditis resolution during follow-up (AUC 0.76, 95% CI 0.58-0.93, p = 0.02). A multiparametric model including epicardial LV GLS, fever and elevated WBC count on admission could be useful for early diagnosing an acute myocarditis, especially when CMRI is not promptly available. Baseline epicardial LV GLS may also identify patients with less-likely myocarditis resolution.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).","Authors":"Degiovanni, A.; Pastore, M. C.; Spinoni, E.

Imaging plays a pivotal role in the management of stroke patients. Haemorrhagic stroke diagnosis is straightforward using a Computed Tomography (CT) scan whereas early ischemic strokes are sometimes difficult to diagnose by imaging. The use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) may diagnose ischemic stroke more convincingly; however MRI remains less available, time consuming and complicated. Unenhanced CT can be performed quickly; can help to identify early signs of stroke. Aim(s): To determine the validity of CT in the evaluation of acute ischemic stroke compared to MRI for early diagnosis. Material(s) and Method(s): The study was a cross-sectional study conducted in the Department of Radiodiagnosis, Agartala Government Medical College and GB Pant Hospital, Agartala, Tripura, India. The study period was from December 2018 to December 2020 and included 70 patients. The instruments used were SIEMENS 128 slice CT-SOMATOM model definition AS and SIEMENS 3.0 Tesla MRI-SKYRA model. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows, version 25.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, USA) was used for data analysis. Result(s): Out of all patients (n=70) 63 patients were ultimately found to have infarction. Out of these 63 cases of infarction 69.84%(n=44) were male and 30.16% (n=19)were female. Sensitivity of CT scan was 87.3%, specificity was 71.4%, positive predictive value was 96.4%, negative predictive value was 38.4% and accuracy was 85.7%. The p-value was 0.002. In all patients who presented before 6 hours (n=15) showed decreased creatinine value during Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) in the lesion area compared to the normal side of brain. None of the patients showed variation in the lactate value. Those presenting after 6 hours (n=48), creatinine was reduced in all the cases (100%), Choline was increased in 89.6%. Conclusion(s): Sensitivity and specificity of CT scan is lower than MRI. Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) has 100 % sensitivity in diagnosing acute infarction.Copyright © 2021 Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

However, knowledge about episode duration is scarce, and risk factors for short or long subclinical AF episodes have yet to be recognized. The aim of the study was to assess AF by long-term continuous screening and to investigate predictors of episodes lasting >=6 minutes, >=5.5 hours, or >=24 hours, respectively. Method(s): A total of 597 patients aged >=70 years and diagnosed with >=1 of hypertension, diabetes, previous stroke, or heart failure were recruited from the general population to receive implantable loop recorder with remote monitoring. Exclusion criteria included history of AF or cardiac implantable electronic device. AF episodes were adjudicated by senior cardiologists. Result(s): During 40 (37; 42) months of continuous monitoring, AF was detected in 209 (35%) of the patients.

The primary CVD outcome was a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), acute coronary syndrome not resulting in MI, stroke, acute decompensated heart failure and CVD death. Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics were used to evaluate the association of interest in 9334 SPRINT participants (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01206062)., RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 3.33 years (interquartile range 2.87-3.87 years), 618 (6.6%) participants experienced a primary CVD outcome. Participants with serum bicarbonate <22 mEq/L had a significantly higher risk of the primary CVD outcome (hazard ratio 1.54; 95% confidence interval 1.11-2.14, P = 0.01), compared with participants with bicarbonate 22-26 mEq/L.

The clinical manifestations and genetic characteristics underlying TAAD patients in Taiwan, however, remain unclear., METHODS: We consecutively recruited patients referred for TAAD screening and/or management at a tertiary medical center in Taiwan. All patients received a comprehensive survey of the clinical manifestations and a genetic testing with a 29-gene next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel., RESULTS: Patients (n = 107) were referred for different reasons, and could be grouped into 4 categories: known aortic aneurysm or dissection (AoAD) (n = 57), Marfanoid features (n = 36), having family members of suspected AoAD (n = 11), and ectopic lens (n = 3). AoAD were confirmed in 73 (68.2%) of the entire cohort. Among all the clinical manifestations, skin striae distensae was the only physical sign that showed significant association with AoAD (p = 0.007 after adjusted). Disease-causing genes/variants were identified in 46 patients (43.0%); FBN1 was the most prevalent disease-causing gene, followed by TGFBR1, TGFBR2 and FBN2. A positive genetic testing was not only an independent predictor of AoAD (hazard ratio (HR) 3.468, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.541-7.807], p = 0.003), but also had a higher chance of dissection among the patients with known dilated aorta (HR 4.552, 95% CI [1.578-13.135], p = 0.005)., CONCLUSION: The presence of skin striae distensae may serve as a clinical cue for physicians to search for AoAD in subjects who are at risk. The NGS panel test not only helps confirm the diagnosis, but also stratify the risk of dissection among patients with dilated aorta. Copyright © 2021 Formosan Medical Association.

Among primary prevention patients, we sought to determine the CAC scores equivalent to ASCVD mortality rates observed in the FOURIER trial, a modern secondary prevention cohort., METHODS AND RESULTS: For the main analysis, we included participants from the CAC Consortium >=50 years old with a 10-year ASCVD risk >=7.5% (n = 20,207). Poisson regression was used to define the relationship between CAC and annual ASCVD mortality. Equations generated from the regression models were then used to derive CAC scores associated with equivalent annual ASCVD mortality as observed in FOURIER placebo participants from the overall trial and in key trial subgroups. The CAC Consortium participants had a similar age (65.5 versus 62.5 years) and sex (22% versus 24% female) distribution as FOURIER. The annualized ASCVD mortality rate in FOURIER participants (0.766 per 100 person-years) corresponded to a CAC score of 781 (418-1467). A CAC score of 255 (162-394) corresponded to an ASCVD mortality rate equivalent to the lowest risk FOURIER subgroup (presence of myocardial infarction >2 years prior to trial enrollment). No CAC score produced a risk equivalent to high-risk FOURIER subgroups, particularly those with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease and/or multivessel coronary heart disease., CONCLUSIONS: Primary prevention individuals with increased CAC burden may have annualized ASCVD mortality rates equivalent to persons with stable secondary prevention-level risk. These findings argue for a risk continuum between higher risk primary prevention and stable secondary prevention patients, as their ASCVD risks may overlap. Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

We performed an untargeted examination of 175 biomarkers to identify those with the strongest association with CKD and to examine the association of those biomarkers with long-term outcomes. Method(s): A total of 175 different biomarkers from MI patients enrolled in the Swedish Web-System for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-Based Care in Heart Disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies (SWEDEHEART) registry were analysed either by a multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry assay or by a multiplex assay (proximity extension assay). Random forests statistical models were used to assess the predictor importance of biomarkers, CKD and outcomes. Result(s): A total of 1098 MI patients with a median estimated glomerular filtration rate of 85 mL min-1/1.73 m2 were followed for a median of 3.2 years. The random forests analyses, without and with adjustment for differences in demography, comorbidities and severity of disease, identified six biomarkers (adrenomedullin, TNF receptor-1, adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein-4, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor 2, growth differentiation factor-15 and TNF receptor-2) to be strongly associated with CKD. All six biomarkers were also amongst the 15 strongest predictors for death, and four of them were amongst the strongest predictors of subsequent MI and heart failure hospitalization. Conclusion(s): In patients with MI, a proteomic approach could identify six biomarkers that best predicted CKD. These biomarkers were also amongst the most important predictors of long-term outcomes. Thus, these biomarkers indicate underlying mechanisms that may contribute to the poor prognosis seen in patients with MI and CKD.Copyright © 2020 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine","Authors":"Edfors, R.; Lindhagen, L.; Spaak, J.; Evans, M.; Andell, P.; Baron, T.; Mortberg, J.; Rezeli, M.; Salzinger, B.; Lundman, P.; Szummer, K.; Tornvall, P.; Wallen, H.

This study was aimed at demonstrating the relationship between CAR and the occurrence of ischemia on gated SPECT MPI. Method(s): We retrospectively evaluated 2.048 referred patients for gated SPECT MPI from a cardiology outpatient clinic between October 2017 and June 2019. After applying exclusion criteria and measuring serum CRP and albumin levels, we included 126 patients in the study. We then classified subjects into different groups according to the absence or presence of ischemia on gated SPECT MPI. Result(s): According to laboratory findings, hs-CRP and CAR were significantly higher in the ischemia group, while the serum albumin was significantly lower in ischemia group (p<0.05 for each). The independent predictors of presence of ischemia in multivariate analysis were hypertension and CAR (CAR; odds ratio: 5.720, 95% confidence interval: 2.697-12.133, p<0.001).

Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are two interrelated and preventable disorders. However, they are responsible for significant global mortality from cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Clinical studies have demonstrated that global longitudinal strain (GLS) using speckle tracking echocardiography (STE), can assess myocardial function accurately in apparently, healthy patients with diabetes and obesity in the settings of acute and chronic ischemia and suspected cardiomyopathy without heart failure. No such studies have been published to date regarding subclinical detection of cardiac dysfunction among obese patients with T2DM. This study aims to investigate the role of STE in the early pre-clinical diagnosis of impairment of diastolic and systolic functions in obese patients with T2DM. This study also investigated whether it is possible to detect early pre-clinical impairment of diastolic and systolic dysfunction in obese T2DM patients, via Tissue Doppler Imaging (TDI), maximum rate of left ventricular pressure development (peak dP/dt) and GLS using STE for comparison. Subjects and Methods. After clearance from the review board of Dibba-Hospital, Alfujairah, UAE, all the available records of patients with the diagnosis of obesity and diabetes were examined. The study included 214 patients presenting with obesity in conjunction with diabetes and 93 age-matched healthy control subjects. Conventional transthoracic two dimensional echocardiography (CE), myocardial Doppler-derived early diastolic (E) and atrial pre systolic (A) velocities and GLS by STE was performed among all the patients and subjects along with tissue Doppler imaging (TDI). This study assessed maximal rate of pressure rise during ventricular contraction (peak dP/dt) in diabetes induced dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) with mitral valve incompetence. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), GLS and TDI were also obtained, among all the subjects. Results. The results show that cardiac functions via conventional echocardiography (CE) were similar in the 2 groups. Using TDI and conventional mitral Doppler flow, obese subjects with diabetes showed an evidence of diastolic function abnormalities in the form of lower mitral annular early septal (Ea) velocity (9.5 +/- 2.9 vs. 18.4 +/- 3.5 cm/s, p < 0.0001), an increased mitral annular late (Aa) velocity (16.5 +/- 2.4 vs. 14.1 +/- 2.2 cm/s, p < 0.05), higher left ventricular filling pressure (E/Ea = 12 +/- 4.4 vs 8 +/- 3.1), p < 0.05), as well as a reduced Ea/Aa ratio (1.00 +/- 0.2 vs. 1.45 +/- 0.3, p < 0.0001, in the study group versus control group. respectively. This study also showed that severely obese subjects (BMI >35) (n = 26) had reduced left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic functions compared with healthy controls. Regarding, systolic function indices, the findings revealed lower average longitudinal peak systolic strain (GLS),-13.5% +/-1.4 vs-19.54% +/- 4.5; in a symptomatic patients versus age matched healthy subjects respectively, (p < 0.001), although, LVEF remained normal (56.48% +/- 8.81). Among patients with DCM (n = 26), the findings reveal that global longitudinal systolic strain (GLS) is highly correlated with maximum rate of LV pressure development (dp/dt), although the LVEF remained normal, in comparison to GLS and dp/dt. (-9.54 +/- 4.50 and 849.9 +/- 277.0); respectively, r =.790, *p< 0.001). However, the frequency/grade of DCM detected by STE, among patients having obesity with T2DM, correlated closely with the degree of obesity, metabolic abnormalities and clustering of other major risk factors, especially high blood pressure. The findings also revealed that chest pain due to coronary heart disease (CAD), dyspnea and DCM were more common among female patients compared to men. Conclusion. The results indicate that patients having obesity with T2DM should be advised to undertake early TDI and STE for early diagnosis of decreased cardiac diastolic and systolic functions and cardiomyopathy, which is likely to be missed by conventional echocardiography. Significant di ferences in regional and global strain were also identified between the severely obese diabetic (BMI >= 35) patients compared to less obese subjects.Copyright © 2020 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Authors":"Elkilany, G.

Early diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction may improve patient care and reduce both complications and hospital costs. A study was performed to investigate the feasibility of early diagnosis of myocardial infarction within the first 9 hours of the hospital stay., METHODS: The records of all patients admitted with chest pain within one calendar year were analyzed. The timing of creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) quantification was determined with reference to the initial phlebotomy (time 0). An enzymatic diagnosis of myocardial infarction was assigned if any determination of CK-MB exceeded the upper limit of normal, and the diagnosis of each patient at or before 9 hours (early diagnosis) was compared to the ultimate diagnosis at 14 to 24 hours (final diagnosis) beyond initial assessment., RESULTS: Of the 528 included patients, 523 patients (99.1%) had identical early and final diagnostic outcomes; 5 patients (0.9%) had conflicting results. An early diagnosis of myocardial infarction was assigned to 195 of the 528 patients (36.9%). Of these, 190 achieved the diagnosis within 9 hours (sensitivity 97.4%). The negative predictive value was 98.5%., CONCLUSION: Standard CK-MB mass measurements within 9 hours of arrival provided an accurate clinical assessment in > 99% of the cases. The high sensitivity and negative predictive values suggest that early diagnosis of myocardial infarction is feasible and reliable. Copyright © 2019.

During platelet activation and aggregation process, platelets may cause increased release of several proinflammatory, and prothrombotic mediators, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and extracellular vesicles (EVs). In the current study we aimed to assess circulating miRNAs profile related to platelet function and inflammation and circulating EVs from platelets, leukocytes, and endothelial cells to analyse their diagnostic and predictive utility in patients with acute IS., METHODS: The study population consisted of 28 patients with the diagnosis of the acute IS. The control group consisted of 35 age- and gender-matched patients on acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) therapy without history of stroke and/or TIA with established stable coronary artery disease (CAD) and concomitant cardiovascular risk factors. Venous blood samples were collected from the control group and patients with IS on ASA therapy (a) 24 h after onset of acute IS, (b) 7-days following index hospitalization. Flow cytometry was used to determine the concentration of circulating EVs subtypes (from platelets, leukocytes, and endothelial cells) in platelet-depleted plasma and qRT-PCR was used to determine several circulating plasma miRNAs (miR-19a-3p, miR-186-5p and let-7f)., RESULTS: Patients with high platelet reactivity (HPR, based on arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregometry) had significantly elevated platelet-EVs (CD62+) and leukocyte-EVs (CD45+) concentration compared to patients with normal platelet reactivity at the day of 1 acute-stroke (p = 0.012, p = 0.002, respectively). Diagnostic values of baseline miRNAs and EVs were evaluated with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The area under the ROC curve for miR-19a-3p was 0.755 (95% CI, 0.63-0.88) p = 0.004, for let-7f, it was 0.874 (95% CI, 0.76-0.99) p = 0.0001; platelet-EVs was 0.776 (95% CI, 0.65-0.90) p = 0.001, whereas for leukocyte-EVs, it was 0.715 (95% CI, 0.57-0.87) p = 0.008. ROC curve showed that pooling the miR-19a-3p expressions, platelet-EVs, and leukocyte-EVs concentration yielded a higher AUC than the value of each individual biomarker as AUC was 0.893 (95% CI, 0.79-0.99). Patients with moderate stroke had significantly elevated miR-19a-3p expression levels compared to patients with minor stroke at the first day of IS. (AUC: 0.867, (95% CI, 0.74-0.10) p = 0.001)., CONCLUSION: Combining different biomarkers of processes underlying IS pathophysiology might be beneficial for early diagnosis of ischemic events. Thus, we believe that in the future circulating biomarkers might be used in the prehospital phase of IS. In particular, circulating plasma EVs and non-coding RNAs including miRNAs are interesting candidates as bearers of circulating biomarkers due to their high stability in the blood and making them highly relevant biomarkers for IS diagnostics.","Authors":"Eyileten, Ceren; Jakubik, Daniel; Shahzadi, Andleeb; Gasecka, Aleksandra; van der Pol, Edwin; De Rosa, Salvatore; Siwik, Dominika; Gajewska, Magdalena; Mirowska-Guzel, Dagmara; Kurkowska-Jastrzebska, Iwona; Czlonkowska, Anna; Postula, Marek","Publisher":"International journal of molecular sciences","Issue":"9","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms23094530","Pages":"Not Available","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"extracellular vesicles (EVs) & miRNAs in particular CD45+ & CD61+ EVs & miR-19a-3p and let-7f"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":37,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":947,"Title":"The Value of Serum YKL-40 and TNF- alpha in the Diagnosis of Acute ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction","Year":2022,"Country":"","Abstract":"Background. Acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a serious cardiovascular disease that poses a great threat to the life and health of patients. Therefore, early diagnosis is important for STEMI patient treatment and prognosis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the value of serum YKL-40 and TNF-alpha in the diagnosis of STEMI. Methods. From October 2020 to February 2022, 120 patients with STEMI were admitted to the Chest Pain Center of the Second People's Hospital of Hefei, and 81 patients with negative coronary angiography were selected as the control group. Serum YKL-40 and TNF-alpha concentrations were measured by sandwich ELISA. Pearson correlation was used to analyze the correlation between serum YKL-40, TNF-alpha, and serum troponin I (cTnI) in STEMI patients; multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to screen independent risk factors for STEMI. Three diagnostic models were constructed: cTnI univariate model (model A), combined serum YKL-40 and TNF-alpha model other than cTnI (model B), and combined cTnI and serum YKL-40 and TNF-alpha model (model C). We assessed the clinical usefulness of the diagnostic model by comparing AUC with decision curve analysis (DCA). Results. Serum YKL-40 and TNF-alpha in the STEMI group were significantly higher than those in the control group (P<0.001). On Pearson correlation analysis, there was a significant positive correlation between serum YKL-40, TNF-alpha, and cTnI levels in STEMI patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that serum YKL-40 and TNF-alpha were independent risk factors for the development of STEMI. The results of ROC analysis showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of serum YKL-40 for predicting the occurrence of STEMI was 0.704. The AUC of serum TNF-alpha for predicting the occurrence of STEMI was 0.852. The AUC of cTnI as a traditional model, model A, for predicting the occurrence of STEMI was 0.875. Model B predicted STEMI with an AUC of 0.851. The addition of serum YKL-40 and serum TNF-alpha to the traditional diagnostic model composed of cTnI constituted a new diagnostic model; that is, the AUC of model C for predicting the occurrence of STEMI was 0.930. Model C had a better net benefit between a threshold probability of 70-95% for DCA. Conclusion. In this study, we demonstrate the utility of serum YKL-40 and TNF-alpha as diagnostic markers for STEMI and the clinical utility of diagnostic models by combining serum YKL-40 and TNF-alpha with cTnI.Copyright © 2022 Caoyang Fang et al.","Authors":"Fang, C.; Chen, Z.; Zhang, J.; Pan, J.; Jin, X.; Yang, M.; Huang, L.","Publisher":"Cardiology Research and Practice","Issue":"Not Available","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/4905954","Pages":"4905954","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"serum YKL-40 and TNF-alpha concentrations"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":3,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":950,"Title":"The clinical value of long noncoding RNA GAS5 in acute ischemic stroke: Correlation with disease risk, inflammation, severity, and risk of recurrence","Year":2022,"Country":"","Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Long noncoding RNA growth arrest-specific 5 (lnc-GAS5) is involved in the pathophysiology of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) by regulating vascular stenosis, inflammation, and neurocyte apoptosis.

In patients with AIS, disease severity was evaluated using National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, and plasma inflammatory cytokine levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was calculated during a 36-month follow-up period., RESULTS: Lnc-GAS5 expression levels were higher in patients with AIS than in the controls (p < 0.001), and it had the potential to discriminate the controls from patients with AIS (area under the curve: 0.893, 95% confidence interval: 0.849-0.938). In patients with AIS, elevated lnc-GAS5 levels were positively correlated with NIHSS score (r = 0.397, p < 0.001), diabetes mellitus (p = 0.046), and higher levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha; r = 0.374, p < 0.001), interleukin-6 (IL-6; r = 0.223, p < 0.001), and interleukin-17A (IL-17A; r = 0.222, p = 0.015).

The objective is to estimate the risk of significant coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with cardiogenic acute chest pain for whom the diagnosis of infarction was ruled out in the emergency department with a nondiagnostic ECG and negative high-sensitivity troponins. We prospectively recruited 1625 patients from emergency departments of seven Spanish hospitals. The outcome was presence of significant CAD determined by presence of ischaemia in functional tests or more than 70% stenosis in imaging tests. In this study, we developed a predictive model and evaluated its performance and clinical utility. The prevalence of significant CAD was 14% [227/1625; 95% confidence interval (CI), 12-16]. MAPAC Cardio-PreTest model included seven predictors: age, sex, smoking, history of hypertension, family history of CAD, history of hyperuricaemia, and type of chest pain. The optimism-adjusted model discrimination was C-statistic 0.654 (95% CI, 0.618-0.693). Calibration plot showed good agreement between the predicted and observed risks, and calibration slope was 0.880 (95% CI, 0.731-1.108) and calibration-in-the-large -0.001 (95% CI, -0.141 to 0.132). The model increased net benefit and improved risk classification over the recommended approach by the European Society of Cardiology [Net Reclassification Index (NRI) of events = 5.3%, NRI of nonevents = 7.0%]. MAPAC Cardio-PreTest model is an online prediction tool to estimate the individualised probability of significant CAD in patients with acute chest pain without a diagnosis of infarction in emergency department. The model was more useful than the current alternatives in helping patients and clinicians make individually tailored choices about the intensity of monitoring or additional coronary tests.

We used data from EXAMINE trial to investigate whether a multi-proteomic approach would provide specific proteomic signatures and also improve the prognostic capacity for determining the risk of cardiovascular death, MI, stroke, heart failure [HF], all-cause death, and combinations of these outcomes., METHODS: 93 circulating proteins (92 from the Olink R CVDII plus troponin) were assessed in 5131 patients. Cox, competing risks, and reclassification measures were applied., RESULTS: The clinical model showed good discrimination and calibration for all outcomes. On top of the clinical model that included age, sex, smoking, diabetes duration, history of MI (prior to the index MI of inclusion), history of HF hospitalization, history of stroke, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, systolic blood pressure, statin therapy, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and study treatment (alogliptin or placebo), troponin and BNP added prognostic information to the composite of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke (C-index + 5%) and cardiovascular death alone (C-index + 7%).

The conventional PAD detection methods are invasive, cumbersome, or require expensive equipment and highly trained technicians. Here, we propose a new automated, noninvasive, and easy-to-use method for the detection of PAD based on characterizing the arterial system by applying an external varying pressure using a cuff. The superposition of the internal arterial pressure and the externally applied pressure were measured and mathematically modeled as a function of cuff pressure. A feature-based learning algorithm was then designed to identify PAD patterns by analyzing the parameters of the derived mathematical models. Genetic algorithm and principal component analysis were employed to select the best predictive features distinguishing PAD patterns from normal. A RUSBoost ensemble model using neural network as the base learner was designed to diagnose PAD from genetic algorithm selected features. The proposed method was validated on data collected from 14 PAD patients and 19 healthy individuals. It achieved a high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 91.4%, 90.0%, and 92.1%, respectively, in detecting PAD. The effect of age, a confounding factor that may have impacted our analyzes, was not considered in this study. The proposed method shows promise toward noninvasive and accurate detection of PAD and can be integrated into routine oscillometric blood pressure measurements.","Authors":"Forghani, Nosratallah; Maghooli, Keivan; Jafarnia Dabanloo, Nader; Vasheghani Farahani, Ali; Forouzanfar, Mohamad","Publisher":"IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics","Issue":"8","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2021.3065379","Pages":"3209-3218","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"model using arterial elastic properties"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":19,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":24,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":1031,"Title":"Left atrial volume index is superior to left atrial diameter index in relation to coronary heart disease in hypertension patients with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction","Year":2020,"Country":"","Abstract":"Objective: Research hypothesis is that left atrial (LA) volume index is superior to LA diameter index for coronary heart disease and LA volume index is important to refine risk stratification. Methods: We retrospectively enrolled 222 asymptomatic non-ischemic patients with hypertension who had stored digital images in 2012. Patients were followed up for coronary heart disease over a median of 3.2 years. The Area under receiver operating characteristic curve for LA parameters with coronary heart disease was evaluated. Cox regression was used to assess the association between left atrial parameters and coronary heart disease. Results: The mean age of patients was 62 years, 45% were men, and mean left atrial diameter, mean left atrial volume, mean LA diameter index, mean LA volume index was 32 mm, 43 ml, 21 mm/m2, 27 ml/m2, respectively.

LA volume index had independent prognostic implications in terms of coronary heart disease prediction in hypertension patients with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction.","Authors":"Fu, Ming; Zhou, Dan; Tang, Songtao; Zhou, Yingling; Feng, Yingqing; Geng, Qingshan","Publisher":"Clinical and experimental hypertension (New York, N.Y. : 1993)","Issue":"1","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10641963.2018.1557680","Pages":"1-7","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"Left atrial volume index"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":6,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":24,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":1049,"Title":"Isolated ascending aorta dilatation is associated with increased risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm","Year":2021,"Country":"","Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an asymptomatic condition characterized by progressive dilatation of the aorta. The purpose of this study is to identify important 2D-TTE aortic indices associated with AAA as predictive tools for undiagnosed AAA., METHODS: In this retrospective study, we evaluated the size of the ascending aorta in patients without known valvular diseases or hemodynamic compromise as predictive tool for undiagnosed AAA. We studied the tubular ascending aorta of 170 patients by 2-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography (2D-TTE). Patients were further divided into two groups, 70 patients with AAA and 100 patients without AAA with normal imaging results., RESULTS: Dilatation of tubular ascending aorta was measured in patients with AAA compared to the group with absent AAA (37.5 +/- 4.8 mm vs. 31.2 +/- 3.6 mm, p < 0.001, respectively) and confirmed by computed tomographic (CT) (35.6 +/- 5.1 mm vs. 30.8 +/- 3.7 mm, p < 0.001, respectively). An increase in tubular ascending aorta size was associated with the presence of AAA by both 2D-TTE and CT (r = 0.40, p < 0.001 and r = 0.37, p < 0.001, respectively). The tubular ascending aorta (D diameter) size of >=33 mm or >= 19 mm/m2 presented with 2-4 times more risk of AAA presence (OR 4.68, CI 2.18-10.25, p = 0.001 or OR 2.63, CI 1.21-5.62, p = 0.02, respectively). In addition, multiple logistic regression analysis identified tubular ascending aorta (OR 1.46, p < 0.001), age (OR 1.09, p = 0.013), gender (OR 0.12, p = 0.002), and LVESD (OR 1.24, p = 0.009) as independent risk factors of AAA presence., CONCLUSIONS: An increased tubular ascending aortic diameter, measured by 2D-TTE, is associated with the presence of AAA. Routine 2D-TTE screening for silent AAA by means of ascending aorta analysis, may appear useful especially in older patients with a dilated tubular ascending aorta (>=33 mm).","Authors":"Gallego-Colon, Enrique; Yosefy, Chaim; Cherniavsky, Evgenia; Osherov, Azriel; Khalameizer, Vladimir; Piltz, Xavier; Pery, Marina; Bruoha, Sharon; Jafari, Jamal","Publisher":"Journal of cardiothoracic surgery","Issue":"1","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13019-021-01488-w","Pages":"108","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"ascending aorta size"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":18,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":1052,"Title":"Impact of a NDUFC2 Variant on the Occurrence of Acute Coronary Syndromes","Year":2022,"Country":"","Abstract":"Background: Among several potential mechanisms, mitochondrial dysfunction has been proposed to be involved in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease (CAD). A mitochondrial complex I deficiency severely impairs cardiovascular health and contributes to CAD development. Previous evidence highlighted a key role of NDUFC2, a subunit of complex I, deficiency in the increased occurrence of renal and cerebrovascular damage in an animal model of hypertension, and of juvenile ischemic stroke occurrence in humans. Furthermore, a significant decrease of NDUFC2 mRNA was detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients experiencing acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The T allele at NDUFC2/rs23117379 variant is known to associate with reduced gene expression and mitochondrial dysfunction. Objective(s): In the present study we tested the impact of the T/C NDUFC2/rs23117379 variant on occurrence of ACS in a prospective cohort of CAD patients (n = 260). Result(s): Hypertension, smoking habit, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia were present in a large proportion of patients. Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) represented the most frequent type of ACS (44%, n = 115), followed by ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) (34%, n = 88) and unstable angina (22%, n = 57). The alleles/genotypes distribution for T/C at NDUFC2/rs23117379 revealed that the TT genotype was associated with a trend toward the development of ACS at an earlier age (TT 61 +/- 12, CT 65 +/- 12 and CC 66 +/- 11 years; p = 0.051 after adjustment for gender, hypertension, smoking habit, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia) and with a significant predictive role for ACS recurrence (hazard ratio [HR]1.671; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.138-2.472; p = 0.009). Conclusion(s): Our findings are consistent with a deleterious effect of NDUFC2 deficiency on acute coronary events predisposition and further support a role of the NDUFC2/rs23117379 variant as a genetic cardiovascular risk factor.Copyright © 2022 Gallo, Migliarino, Cotugno, Stanzione, Burocchi, Bianchi, Marchitti, Autore, Volpe and Rubattu.","Authors":"Gallo, G.; Migliarino, S.; Cotugno, M.; Stanzione, R.; Burocchi, S.; Bianchi, F.; Marchitti, S.; Autore, C.; Volpe, M.; Rubattu, S.","Publisher":"Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine","Issue":"Not Available","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fcvm.2022.921244","Pages":"921244","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"NDUFC2 variant rs23117379"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":15,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":1062,"Title":"C1q tumor necrosis factor-related protein 4 is associated with coronary artery disease in patients with type 2 diabetes","Year":2022,"Country":"","Abstract":"AIMS/INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the correlation of circulating C1q tumor necrosis factor-related protein 4 (CTRP4) with coronary artery disease (CAD) in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients., METHODS: A total of 240 individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus were enrolled in our center between January 2020 and December 2020. They were assigned into two groups, including the CAD and non-CAD groups, based on coronary angiography or computed tomography angiography findings. Serum CTRP4 levels were detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. The association of CTRP4 with CAD was determined by logistic regression analysis. The predictive value of CTRP4 for CAD was calculated by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis., RESULTS: Median serum CTRP4 amounts were markedly elevated in the CAD group in comparison with the non-CAD group (10.37 vs 3.75 ng/mL, P < 0.01). Binary logistic regression showed that CTRP4 was associated with CAD and even the amount of coronary artery lesions (P < 0.05). In receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was greater for CTRP4 compared with HbA1c or CRP (0.87 vs 0.74, 0.87 vs 0.80, P < 0.01). The area under the curve for CTRP4 and glycated hemoglobin in combination was larger than that obtained for CTRP4 combined with CRP (0.91 vs 0.87, P < 0.01). According to the maximum Youden index criteria, the optimal cut-off of CTRP4 was 5.42 ng/mL, which yielded a sensitivity of 84.4% and a specificity of 76.7% in predicting CAD in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients., CONCLUSIONS: Serum CTRP4 levels are positively correlated with CAD occurrence and severity. Combining CTRP4 and glycated hemoglobin has a better predictive value for CAD in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

After describing a new drainage route from brain to nasal mucosa, nasal exudate samples can be considered a new and promising source of biomarkers. Saliva can also be evaluated. Methods We determined iron in nasal exudate and saliva samples from patients of acute stroke during the first 48 h from onset. A simple, non-invasive sampling procedure was employed to obtain information from the brain. Samples were taken with a pre-weighed swab, solved in a 2% nitric acid solution and iron was measured by inductively coupled plasma-tandem mass spectrometry (ICP-MS/MS). Results A significant difference in the dispersion of results of iron concentration for both stroke subtypes was observed in nasal exudate samples. The interquartile range was 0.608 nmol mg-1 of iron for hemorrhagic strokes and only 0.044 nmol mg-1 for ischemic strokes. In saliva samples, however, the values were 0.236 vs. 0.157 nmol mg-1. A cut-off limit of 0.102 nmol of iron per mg of nasal exudate provides a methodology with a 90% of sensitivity and a 90% of specificity. The value of the area under (AUC) the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) for nasal exudate samples is 0.960, considered as very good in which regards to its predictive value. Conclusions Non-invasive samples of nasal secretion have allowed obtaining, for the first time, information from the brain. Determination of iron in nasal exudate by ICP-MS allowed differentiation between ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes.","Authors":"Garcia-Cabo, Carmen; Llano-Suarez, Pablo; Benavente-Fernandez, Lorena; Calleja-Puerta, Sergio; Costa-Fernandez, Jose Manuel; Fernandez-Abedul, M.

Aim(s): Our goal was to analyze the prognostic role of risk factors (RF), comorbidities and levels of specific biomarkers: asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), homocysteine (HCY) and vitamin B12 (VB12) for MACE in Bulgarian patients with significant CAD. Material(s) and Method(s): We studied 98 patients with significant CAD, mean age 67.46 years, hospitalized in Cardiology Clinic of UMHAT \"Alexandrovska\" during the period between 2014 and 2020 years. They were divided into two groups, depending on whether they underwent carotid arterial stenting (CAS) (84 in total) or not (14 in total). The differences in RF, comorbidities and ADMA, HCY and VB12 between the two studied groups were assessed, as well as their prognostic value for MACE appearance, using parametric methods (Chi-square test) and ROC analysis. Result(s): Patients with stroke had a significantly higher incidence of arterial hypertension (AH) (87.1 %, p < 0.009), diabetes mellitus (DM) type 2 (29,0 % p < 0.028) and smoking (38.7 %, p < 0.028) compared to those without stroke. The rates of dyslipidemia and obesity did not show statistically significant differences between the two studied groups. Regression analysis showed that AH was the most significant RF for the occurrence of stroke (OR 3.99, p <0.04). Moreover, the incidence of AH was significantly higher in patients with previous myocardial infarction (p <0.031). No statistical significance was found for dyslipidemia, DM type 2, obesity and smoking in both groups (with/without MI). In the studied patients with CAD, potential factors for MACE were: previous stroke (p < 0.017) and MI (p < 0.047), and the presence of stroke increased almost 4 times the risk of death /OR=3.765/. Importantly in all patients with known significant CAD, whether or not they underwent stenting, ADMA and HCY values were significantly elevated (p <0.001), compared to the control group (healthy volunteers without known carotid pathology were assessed as a control group), and cut-off values related to an increased risk for MACE were > 0.91 for ADMA and > 12.25 for HCY, respectively. Conclusion(s): Based on these data we could recommend: patients with known carotid artery disease with or without interventional treatment, aged over 69.5 years, with the presence of AH, DM type 2 and smoking, and ADMA / HCY values above 0.91/12.25 Mmol/l respectively, are associated with elevated risk of MACE. The risk is significantly increased if these patients have previous stroke and/ or myocardial infarction.Copyright © 2023 A. CARBONE Editore.

Methods and Results PEGASUS-TIMI 54 (Prevention of Cardiovascular Events in Patients With Prior Heart Attack Using Ticagrelor Compared to Placebo on a Background of Aspirin - Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 54) randomized patients with prior myocardial infarction to ticagrelor or placebo (median follow-up 33 months). Baseline plasma concentrations of TMAO were measured in a nested case-control study of 597 cases with cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (MACE) and 1206 controls matched for age, sex, and estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]. Odds ratios (OR) were used for the association between TMAO quartiles and MACE, adjusting for baseline clinical characteristics (age, sex, eGFR, region, body mass index, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking, peripheral artery disease, index event, aspirin dosage and treatment arm), and cardiovascular biomarkers (hs-TnT [high-sensitivity troponin T], hs-CRP [high-sensitivity C-reactive protein], NT-proBNP [N-terminal-pro-B-type natriuretic peptide]). Higher TMAO quartiles were associated with risk of MACE (OR for quartile 4 versus quartile 1, 1.43, 95% CI, 1.06-1.93, P trend=0.015). The association was driven by cardiovascular death (OR 2.25, 95% CI, 1.28-3.96, P trend=0.003) and stroke (OR 2.68, 95% CI, 1.39-5.17, P trend<0.001).

Several diagnosis approaches such as baseline electrocardiography, echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and coronary angiography are suggested for screening the suspected patients that may suffer from CAD. However, applying such methods may have health side effects and/or expensive costs. Method(s): As an alternative to the available diagnosis tools/methods, this research involves a decision tree learning algorithm called classification and regression tree (CART) for a simple and reliable diagnosis of CAD. Several CART models are developed based on the recently CAD dataset published in the literature. Result(s): Utilizing all the features of the dataset (55 independent parameters), it was found that only 40 independent parameters influence the CAD diagnosis and consequently development of the predictive model. Based on the feature importance obtained from the first CART model, three new CART models are then developed using 18, 10, and 5 selected features. Except for the five-feature CART model, the outcomes of developed CART models demonstrate the maximum achievable accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for CAD diagnosis (100%), while comparing the predictions with the reported targets. The error analysis reveals that the literature models including sequential minimal optimization (SMO), bagging SMO, Naive Bayes (NB), artificial neural network (ANN), C4.5, J48, Bagging, and ANN in conjunction with the genetic algorithm (GA) do not outperform the CART methodology in classifying patients as normal or CAD. Conclusion(s): Hence, the robustness of the tree-based algorithm in accurate and fast predictions is confirmed, implying the proposed classification technique can be successfully utilized to develop a coherent decision-making system for the CAD diagnosis.Copyright © 2020","Authors":"Ghiasi, M.

However, in 349 (38.7%) of the 902 patients, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin was not available for the treating physicians. High sensitivity cardiac troponin T was re-measured from thawed blood samples collected at baseline. This cohort qualified for a re-analysis of the 30-day incidence rate of MACE (death, survived cardiac death, acute myocardial infarction, re-hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome, acute unplanned percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary bypass grafting, or documented life-threatening arrhythmias), or components of the primary endpoint including death or death/MI. After re-measurement of troponin and exclusion of 9 patients with insufficient blood sample volume, 893 patients qualified for re-analysis. A total of 57 cases were detected with high sensitivity cardiac troponin T >= 14 ng/L who had been classified as \"troponin negative\" based on a conventional cardiac troponin T or I < 99th percentile upper limit of normal. Major adverse cardiac events rates after exclusion were non-inferior in the Copeptin group compared to the standard group (4.34% (95% confidence intervals 2.60-6.78%) vs. 4.27% (2.55-6.66%)). Rates were 53% lower in the per-protocol analysis (HR 0.47, 95% CI: 0.18-1.15, p = 0.09). No deaths occurred within 30 days in the discharged low risk patients of the Copeptin group. Copeptin combined with high sensitivity cardiac troponin is useful for risk stratification and allows early discharge of low-to-intermediate risk patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome is as safe as a re-testing strategy at 3 h or later.","Authors":"Giannitsis, Evangelos; Garfias-Veitl, Tania; Slagman, Anna; Searle, Julia; Muller, Christian; Blankenberg, Stefan; von Haehling, Stephan; Katus, Hugo A.; Hamm, Christian W.; Huber, Kurt; Vollert, Jorn O.; Mockel, Martin","Publisher":"Cells","Issue":"2","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cells11020211","Pages":"Not Available","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"dual marker strategy of copeptin and hs-cTnT at presentation"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":24,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":1141,"Title":"Changes in left ventricle myocardial volume during stress test using cadmium-zinc-telluride cardiac imaging: Implications in coronary artery disease","Year":2021,"Country":"","Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Cadmium-zinc-telluride (CZT) SPECT allows the estimation of left ventricle myocardial volume (LVMV). We tested the clinical relevance of rest-stress LVMV changes (DELTA LVMV) in detecting coronary artery disease (CAD, coronary stenosis > 70%), using CZT-SPECT., METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 512 consecutive patients with known or suspected CAD (mean age: 70.3 +/- 9.2 years, 72% male) for stress-rest myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI, single-day stress-rest protocol). We quantified summed stress scores (SSS), summed rest scores, and summed difference scores, together with LVMV and ejection fraction (EF) after stress and at rest. All patients underwent coronary angiography within 30 days., RESULTS: Two hundred seventy-two patients had CAD at coronary angiography. DELTALVMV <= 5 mL, corresponding to 6% of change from rest LVMV, was the best predictor of CAD (AUC = 0.831, 79% sensitivity, 82% specificity), irrespective of the stress protocol (dipyridamole or exercise stress) and independently of MPI-SSS, LV EF, and clinical history (P = 0.004). Integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) and net reclassification improvement (NRI) were significant for the addition of DELTALVMV <= 5 mL (IDI = 6.1%, P < 0.0001; NRI = 29.7%, P = 0.02) to MPI-SSS, whereas the other parameters were not., CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation of DELTALVMV using CZT-SPECT can improve the diagnostic accuracy in predicting the presence of CAD when added to conventional MPI.

Median time from randomisation to CT coronary angiography was 4.2 (interquartile range 1.6-21.6) hours.

A disintegrin and metalloprotease with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS-13) has antithrombotic properties and was repeatedly implicated in the pathophysiology of stroke. In this study, we, therefore, aimed to investigate whether ADAMTS-13 is associated with stroke etiology and the burden of vascular risk factors. Method(s): We determined ADAMTS-13 activity in two prospectively recruited stroke cohorts in the long-term course after the event. Cohort 1 (n = 88) consisted of patients who suffered a stroke due to embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS), cardioembolic stroke due to atrial fibrillation (AF), large-artery atherosclerosis, or small vessel disease. In cohort 2, patients with cryptogenic stroke and patent foramen ovale (PFO) scheduled for PFO closure (n = 38) were enrolled. As measures of vascular risk factor burden, the CHA2DS2VASC score, the Essen Stroke Risk Score (ESRS), and the Risk of Paradoxical Embolism (RoPE) score were calculated, as appropriate. Result(s): ADAMTS-13 activity was lower in patients with AF-related stroke compared to patients with ESUS (p = 0.0227), which was, however, due to confounding by vascular risk factors. ADAMTS-13 activity inversely correlated with the ESRS (r = -0.452, p < 0.001) and CHA2DS2VASC (r = -0.375, p < 0.001) in cohort 1. In accordance with these findings, we found a positive correlation between ADAMTS-13 activity and the RoPE score in cohort 2 (r = 0.413, p = 0.010). Conclusion(s): ADAMTS-13 activity is inversely correlated with the number of vascular risk factors across different stroke etiologies. Further study is warranted to establish ADAMTS-13 as a mediator of cerebrovascular risk.Copyright © 2023 Grosse, Leotescu, Sieweke, Schneppenheim, Budde, Ziegler, Biber, Gabriel, Ernst, Schuppner, Lichtinghagen, Bavendiek, Widder and Weissenborn.","Authors":"Grosse, G.

Early detection of myocardial pathologies can increase the benefit of therapy and reduce the number of lethal cases. Presence of myocardial scar is an indicator for developing ischaemic heart disease and can be detected with high diagnostic precision by magnetic resonance imaging. However, magnetic resonance imaging scanners are expensive and of limited availability. It is known that presence of myocardial scar has an impact on the well-established, reasonably low cost, and almost ubiquitously available electrocardiogram. However, this impact is non-specific and often hard to detect by a physician. We present an artificial intelligence based approach - namely a deep learning model - for the prediction of myocardial scar based on an electrocardiogram and additional clinical parameters. The model was trained and evaluated by applying 6-fold cross-validation to a dataset of 12-lead electrocardiogram time series together with clinical parameters. The proposed model for predicting the presence of scar tissue achieved an area under the curve score, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.89, 70.0, 84.3, and 78.0%, respectively. This promisingly high diagnostic precision of our electrocardiogram-based deep learning models for myocardial scar detection may support a novel, comprehensible screening method.Copyright © 2020 Nils Gumpfer et al., published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston 2020.","Authors":"Gumpfer, N.; Grun, D.; Hannig, J.; Keller, T.; Guckert, M.","Publisher":"Biological Chemistry","Issue":"8","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1515/hsz-2020-0169","Pages":"911-923","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"deep learning model to identify myocardial scar based on ECG"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":37,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":1232,"Title":"Association between plasma betaine levels and dysglycemia in patients with coronary artery disease","Year":2020,"Country":"","Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Dietary betaine intake was reported to associate with favorable profile of metabolic disorders.

Nowadays, HCM is treatable with the advancement of medical interventions. However, due to occult clinical presentations and a lack of easy, inexpensive, and widely popularized screening approaches in the general population, 80-90% HCM patients are not clinically identifiable, which brings certain safety hazards could have been prevented. The majority HCM patients showed abnormal and diverse electrocardiogram (ECG) presentations, it is unclear which ECG parameters are the most efficient for HCM screening. Objective(s): We aimed to develop a pragmatic prediction model based on the most common ECG features to screen for HCM. Method(s): Between April 1st and September 30th, 2020, 423 consecutive subjects from the International Cooperation Center for Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy of Xijing Hospital [172 HCM patients, 251 participants without left ventricular hypertrophy (non-HCM)] were prospectively included in the training cohort. Between January 4th and February 30th, 2021, 163 participants from the same center were included in the temporal internal validation cohort (62 HCM patients, 101 non-HCM participants). External validation was performed using retrospectively collected ECG data from Xijing Hospital (3,232 HCM ECG samples from January 1st, 2000, to March 31st, 2020; 95,184 non-HCM ECG samples from January 1st to December 31st, 2020). The C-statistic was used to measure the discriminative ability of the model. Result(s): Among 30 ECG features examined, all except abnormal Q wave significantly differed between the HCM patients and non-HCM comparators. After several independent feature selection approaches and model evaluation, we included only two ECG features, T wave inversion (TWI) and the amplitude of S wave in lead V1 (SV1), in the HCM prediction model. The model showed a clearly useful discriminative performance (C-statistic > 0.75) in the training [C-statistic 0.857 (0.818-0.896)], and temporal validation cohorts [C-statistic 0.871 (0.812-0.930)]. In the external validation cohort, the C-statistic of the model was 0.833 [0.825-0.841]. A browser-based calculator was generated accordingly. Conclusion(s): The pragmatic model established using only TWI and SV1 may be helpful for predicting the probability of HCM and shows promise for use in population-based HCM screening.Copyright © 2022 Guo, Gao, Yang, Ma, Zhou, Liu, Shao, Wang, Hu, Zhao, Zhang, Guo, Huang, Cui, Song, Sun, Liu, Zhang and Tao.","Authors":"Guo, L.; Gao, C.; Yang, W.; Ma, Z.; Zhou, M.; Liu, J.; Shao, H.; Wang, B.; Hu, G.; Zhao, H.; Zhang, L.; Guo, X.; Huang, C.; Cui, Z.; Song, D.; Sun, F.; Liu, L.; Zhang, F.; Tao, L.","Publisher":"Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine","Issue":"Not Available","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fcvm.2022.889523","Pages":"889523","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"ECG features in particular T wave inversion (TWI) & the amplitude of S wave in lead V1 (SV1)"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":4,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":31,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":1235,"Title":"Novel biomarkers identifying hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and its obstructive variant based on targeted amino acid metabolomics","Year":2022,"Country":"","Abstract":"Background:Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an underdiagnosed genetic heart disease worldwide. The management and prognosis of obstructive HCM (HOCM) and non-obstructive HCM (HNCM) are quite different, but it also remains challenging to discriminate these two subtypes. HCM is characterized by dysmetabolism, and myocardial amino acid (AA) metabolism is robustly changed. The present study aimed to delineate plasma AA and derivatives profiles, and identify potential biomarkers for HCM. Method(s):Plasma samples from 166 participants, including 57 cases of HOCM, 52 cases of HNCM, and 57 normal controls (NCs), who first visited the International Cooperation Center for HCM, Xijing Hospital between December 2019 and September 2020, were collected and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry based on targeted AA metabolomics. Three separate classification algorithms, including random forest, support vector machine, and logistic regression, were applied for the identification of specific AA and derivatives compositions for HCM and the development of screening models to discriminate HCM from NC as well as HOCM from HNCM. Result(s):The univariate analysis showed that the serine, glycine, proline, citrulline, glutamine, cystine, creatinine, cysteine, choline, and aminoadipic acid levels in the HCM group were significantly different from those in the NC group. Four AAs and derivatives (Panel A; proline, glycine, cysteine, and choline) were screened out by multiple feature selection algorithms for discriminating HCM patients from NCs. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis in Panel A yielded an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.83 (0.75-0.91) in the training set and 0.79 (0.65-0.94) in the validation set. Moreover, among 10 AAs and derivatives (arginine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, proline, alanine, asparagine, creatine, tryptophan, ornithine, and choline) with statistical significance between HOCM and HNCM, 3 AAs (Panel B; arginine, proline, and ornithine) were selected to differentiate the two subgroups. The AUC values in the training and validation sets for Panel B were 0.83 (0.74-0.93) and 0.82 (0.66-0.98), respectively. Conclusion(s):The plasma AA and derivatives profiles were distinct between the HCM and NC groups. Based on the differential profiles, the two established screening models have potential value in assisting HCM screening and identifying whether it is obstructive.Copyright © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

The pathophysiologic mechanism of AMI in young adults remains unclear. In this study, we used targeted metabolomics to measure metabolic profile and analyzed plasma fatty acids levels in young adults with AMI, seeking to determine whether circulating fatty acid metabolism was correlated with the occurrence of AMI in young adults. Methods and Results: Consecutive young and elder patients admitted to hospital for AMI were enrolled. Plasma samples of all participants were obtained after overnight fast and then measured using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) based targeted metabolomic platform. A total of 201 plasma metabolites were measured using UPLC-MS/MS. Several plasma fatty acids were significantly altered in young AMI patients compared with control or elder AMI patients, which also showed significant prediction value for AMI in young adults. Percentage of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) was decreased and long chain increased in AMI as compared with control. Moreover, alpha-linolenic acid and linoleic acid metabolism (ALALAM) pathway metabolites were gradually increased in control, young, and elder AMI patients.

Although considerable progress has been made in AMI diagnosis, there remains an urgent need for novel diagnostic biomarkers for its prevention and treatment. Functional exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) are recognized as potential biomarkers in many diseases. This study's objective was to identify specific plasma exosomal miRNAs with biomarker potential for early AMI detection. Method(s): Exosomes from the plasma of 26 coronary artery disease (CAD) patients, 55 AMI patients, and 37 healthy controls were isolated and characterized by transmission electron microcopy (TEM), western blotting, and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). The miRNAs were purified from exosomes, and unique molecular identifier (UMI) small RNA sequencing was performed. The random forest (RF) model was trained to predict potential biomarkers. Result(s): NTA demonstrated that nanoparticle concentration did not change after AMI, while nanoparticle size distribution significantly decreased. The CAD and AMI groups' miRNA expression profiles significantly differed from the healthy group's profile. The RF classifier could be used to distinguish the healthy group from the AMI group, but could not be used to distinguish the CAD group from the other groups, which caused a high classification error rate. Eighteen miRNAs were selected as biomarkers based on their RF classifier significance. The diagnostic accuracy of 18 miRNAs was evaluated using AUC values of 0.93, 0.87, and 0.75 to detect healthy controls, AMI, and CAD, respectively. Conclusion(s): Nanoparticle diameter and the 18 miRNAs may serve as simple and accessible fingerprints for early AMI diagnosis.Copyright © Annals of Translational Medicine.

Microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) affect O2 consumption and play crucial roles in modulating metabolic and cardiovascular health. The epigenetic regulation of the hypoxia-inducible factor 3A (HIF3A) gene is implicated in oxidative metabolism in the pathogenesis of diabetes. Identifying the associations between plasma SCFA levels and intronic DNA methylation of HIF3A may reveal useful predictors or provide insights into the disease processes of DCM. Method(s): In this cross-sectional study, we analyzed plasma SCFA levels, HIF3A expression, and CpG methylation of HIF3A intron 1 in peripheral blood from patients with type 2 diabetes presenting with (n = 92) and without (n = 105) cardiomyopathy. Result(s): Plasma butyric acid levels and HIF3A mRNA expression in peripheral blood were decreased in DCM patients, whereas 3 CpGs in HIF3A intron 1 (CpG 6, CpG 7 and CpG 11) were highly methylated in DCM patients. Interestingly, butyric acid levels positively correlated with HIF3A levels, while a negative association was identified between butyric acid levels and the methylation rates of HIF3A intron 1 at CpG 6. Butyric acid levels also correlated with several clinical/echocardiographic factors in DCM patients. Additionally, the combination of plasma butyric acid levels and HIF3A intron 1 methylation at CpG 6 discriminated DCM patients from type2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. Conclusion(s): The novel associations between plasma butyric acid levels and HIF3A intron 1 methylation at CpG 6 may highlight an underlying mechanism by which the \"microbial-myocardial\" axis and host-microbe interactions may participate in the pathogenesis of DCM.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism","Authors":"Guo, Y.; Zou, J.; Xu, X.; Zhou, H.; Sun, X.; Wu, L.; Zhang, S.; Zhong, X.; Xiong, Z.; Lin, Y.; Huang, Y.; Du, Z.; Liao, X.; Zhuang, X.","Publisher":"Clinical Nutrition","Issue":"6","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2021.04.007","Pages":"3708-3717","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) & methylation of hypoxia-inducible factor 3A (HIF3A) intron 1 CpG 6 & CpG 7 & CpG 1"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":10,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":3,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":18,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":25,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":37,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":1266,"Title":"Estimation of recurrent atherosclerotic cardiovascular event risk in patients with established cardiovascular disease: The updated SMART2 algorithm","Year":2022,"Country":"","Abstract":"Aims: The 10-year risk of recurrent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events in patients with established ASCVD can be estimated with the Secondary Manifestations of ARTerial disease (SMART) risk score, and may help refine clinical management. To broaden generalizability across regions, we updated the existing tool (SMART2 risk score) and recalibrated it with regional incidence rates and assessed its performance in external populations. Methods and Results: Individuals with coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, or abdominal aortic aneurysms were included from the Utrecht Cardiovascular Cohort-SMART cohort [n = 8355; 1706 ASCVD events during a median follow-up of 8.2 years (interquartile range 4.2-12.5)] to derive a 10-year risk prediction model for recurrent ASCVD events (non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or cardiovascular mortality) using a Fine and Gray competing risk-adjusted model. The model was recalibrated to four regions across Europe, and to Asia (excluding Japan), Japan, Australia, North America, and Latin America using contemporary cohort data from each target region. External validation used data from seven cohorts [Clinical Practice Research Datalink, SWEDEHEART, the international REduction of Atherothrombosis for Continued Health (REACH) Registry, Estonian Biobank, Spanish Biomarkers in Acute Coronary Syndrome and Biomarkers in Acute Myocardial Infarction (BACS/BAMI), the Norwegian COgnitive Impairment After STroke, and Bialystok PLUS/Polaspire] and included 369 044 individuals with established ASCVD of whom 62 807 experienced an ASCVD event. C-statistics ranged from 0.605 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.547-0.664] in BACS/BAMI to 0.772 (95% CI 0.659-0.886) in REACH Europe high-risk region. The clinical utility of the model was demonstrated across a range of clinically relevant treatment thresholds for intensified treatment options. Conclusion(s): The SMART2 risk score provides an updated, validated tool for the prediction of recurrent ASCVD events in patients with established ASCVD across European and non-European populations. The use of this tool could allow for a more personalized approach to secondary prevention based upon quantitative rather than qualitative estimates of residual risk.Copyright © The Author(s) 2022.","Authors":"Hageman, S.

This illustrates a yet not appreciated crosstalk between the gastrointestinal and cardiovascular systems, which requires further investigation. The gut-derived hormone Peptide YY (PYY) is secreted from the same intestinal L-cells as GLP-1. Relevance of PYY in the context of cardiovascular disease has not been explored. In this study, we aimed to investigate PYY serum concentrations in patients with acute myocardial infarction and to evaluate their association with cardiovascular events. Material(s) and Method(s): PYY levels were assessed in 834 patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction (553 Non-ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI) and 281 ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)) at the time of hospital admission. The composite outcomes of first occurrence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke (3-P-MACE), and all-cause mortality were assessed with a median follow-up of 338 days. Result(s): PYY levels were significantly associated with age and cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes, and kidney function in addition to biomarkers of heart failure (NT-pro BNP) and inflammation (hs-CRP). Further, PYY was significantly associated with 3-P-MACE (HR: 1.7; 95% CI: 1-2.97; p = 0.0495) and all-cause mortality (HR: 2.69; 95% CI: 1.61-4.47; p = 0.0001) by univariable Cox regression analyses, which was however lost after adjusting for multiple confounders. Conclusion(s): PYY levels are associated with parameters of cardiovascular risk as well as cardiovascular events and mortality in patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction. However, this significant association is lost after adjustment for further confounders.Copyright © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Authors":"Haj-Yehia, E.; Mertens, R.

Immunoglobulins are implicated in cardiovascular disease, although the predictive value of total immunoglobulin G (IgG) has not yet been evaluated in a secondary prevention setting. This study examined whether total IgG is predictive of MACE in an MI population, and how total IgG compared to the predictive value of C-reactive protein (CRP), an acute inflammatory marker. Methods: We conducted a case-control study with 40 MI subjects (cases) who experienced MACE within 1 year of their index admission. Cases were matched for age, sex, diabetes and presentation with 77 controls who did not have MACE. Pre-discharge plasma samples were analysed for total IgG and CRP. Results: We observed higher levels of total plasma IgG in MI subjects with MACE (24.9 (16.2-43.7) mg/mL) compared to controls (18.4 (9.1-37.3) mg/mL; p < 0.05). Higher levels of IgG were associated with increased risk of MACE in our MI population. MI subjects within quartiles 3 and 4 of total IgG had 6 times and 4 times, respectively, the rate of MACE compared to subjects in quartile 1. There was no difference in CRP levels between cases and controls (1.1 (0.5-3.0) vs. 1.9 (0.6-6.1) mg/mL, p = 0.10), and no relationship was observed between CRP and MACE. Conclusion: Pre-discharge IgG level was a better marker for predicting MACE post-MI than CRP, which had no predictive value in this study.","Authors":"Hally, Kathryn E.; Holley, Ana S.; Kristono, Gisela A.; Harding, Scott A.; Larsen, Peter D.","Publisher":"Acta cardiologica","Issue":"6","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00015385.2019.1611189","Pages":"497-502","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"immunoglobulin G"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":24,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":1284,"Title":"Prevalence and predictors of automatically quantified myocardial ischemia within a multicenter international registry","Year":2022,"Country":"","Abstract":"Background: The utility of cardiac stress testing depends on the prevalence of myocardial ischemia within candidate populations.

Little is currently known about the molecular mechanisms and immune infiltration patterns underlying the development and progression of thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysms (TAA and AAA), warranting further research. Method(s): We downloaded AA (includes TAA and AAA) datasets from the GEO database. The potential biomarkers in TAA and AAA were identified using differential expression analysis and two machine-learning algorithms. The discrimination power of the potential biomarkers and their diagnostic accuracy was assessed in validation datasets using ROC curve analysis. Then, GSEA, KEGG, GO and DO analyses were conducted. Furthermore, two immuno-infiltration analysis algorithms were utilized to analyze the common immune infiltration patterns in TAA and AAA. Finally, a retrospective clinical study was performed on 78 patients with AD, and the serum from 6 patients was used for whole exome sequencing (WES). Result(s): The intersection of TAA and AAA datasets yielded 82 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Subsequently, the biomarkers (CX3CR1 and HBB) were acquired by screening using two machine-learning algorithms and ROC curve analysis. The functional analysis of DEGs showed significant enrichment in inflammation and regulation of angiogenic pathways. Immune cell infiltration analysis revealed that adaptive and innate immune responses were closely linked to AA progression. However, neither CX3CR1 nor HBB was associated with B cell-mediated humoral immunity. CX3CR1 expression was correlated with macrophages and HBB with eosinophils. Finally, our retrospective clinical study revealed a hyperinflammatory environment in aortic disease. The WES study identified disease biomarkers and gene variants, some of which may be druggable. Conclusion(s): The genes CX3CR1 and HBB can be used as common biomarkers in TAA and AAA. Large numbers of innate and adaptive immune cells are infiltrated in AA and are closely linked to the development and progression of AA. Moreover, CX3CR1 and HBB are highly correlated with the infiltration of immune cells and may be potential targets of immunotherapeutic drugs.

Although abundant epidemic evidence demonstrates that diabetes is independently associated with the risk of developing heart failure, DbCM is not normally diagnosed in clinical practices due to its exclusive diagnosis, and no diagnostic biomarker was applied in a clinical test., METHODS: To detect the concentrations of serum Annexin A2 in non-diabetic subjects, type 2 diabetic (T2DM) patients with or without DbCM, and analyzed its relationship to parameters of cardiac functions, glucose, lipid metabolism, and renal functions. 266 eligible participants were included and were divided into 3 groups including non-diabetic subjects (NGR), T2DM patients without DbCM (T2DM group), and the DbCM group. Echocardiography, coronary computed tomography angiography, electrocardiogram, blood pressure, thyroid function, and clinical and other biochemical parameters were measured in all participants., RESULTS: Serum Annexin A2 concentrations were higher in DbCM (P < 0.05) and T2DM (P < 0.05) groups compared with the NGR group, especially in DbCM patients. Correlation analysis showed that serum Annexin A2 levels were negatively associated with left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF), LV fractional shortening (FS), the ratio of early (E-wave) and late (A-wave) LV diastolic filling velocities (E/A ratio), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and were positively correlated with age, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) (all P < 0.05). Multiple logistical regression analyses revealed that serum in both the second and the third tertiles of Annexin A2 concentration were significantly associated with DbCM. E/A ratio is the independent factor for Annexin A2 concentration when adjusted for LV FS%, BUN, and Cr., CONCLUSIONS: Circulating Annexin A2 concentrations might be induced in DbCM patients and were negatively associated with cardiac systolic and diastolic functions, which suggested it might be a predictor of early diagnosis in DbCM and might be a potential therapeutic target for DbCM.

Our aim was to determine the prognostic value of the recently introduced ceramide-and phospholipid-based risk score, the Cardiovascular Event Risk Test (CERT2), in patients with stable coronary heart disease on optimal medical therapy and to identify biological processes that contribute to the CERT2 score. METHODS AND RESULTS: Plasma samples (n=11 222) obtained from the STABILITY (Stabilization of Atherosclerotic Plaque by Initiation of Darapladib Therapy) trial were analyzed using a tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method. STABILITY was a trial in patients with stable coronary heart disease randomized to the lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 inhibitor darapladib or placebo on optimized medical therapy at baseline, with a median follow-up of 3.7 years. Hazard ratios per SD for the CERT2 risk score were 1.32 (95% CI, 1.25-1.39) for major adverse cardiovascular event, 1.47 (95% CI, 1.35-1.59) for cardiovascular death, 1.32 (95% CI, 1.16-1.49) for stroke, 1.23 (95% CI, 1.14-1.33) for myocardial infarction, and 1.56 (95% CI, 1.39-1.76) for hospitalization due to heart failure, when adjusted for traditional cardiovascular risk factors. CERT2 showed correlation (P<0.001, r>0.2) with inflammatory markers high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, the heart failure marker N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. After also adjusting for levels of other prognostic biomarkers, the CERT2 score was still independently related to the risk of cardiovascular death but not to nonfatal events. CONCLUSION(S): The CERT2 risk score can detect residual risk in patients with stable coronary heart disease and is associated with biomarkers indicating inflammation, myocardial necrosis, myocardial dysfunction, renal dysfunction, and dyslipidemia.

AIS is a serious cause of mortality and disability. Early diagnosis of atherosclerosis, which is the major cause of AIS, allows therapeutic intervention before the onset, leading to prevention of AIS., METHODS: Serological identification by cDNA expression cDNA libraries and the protein array method were used for the screening of antigens recognized by serum IgG antibodies in patients with atherosclerosis. Recombinant proteins or synthetic peptides derived from candidate antigens were used as antigens to compare serum IgG levels between healthy donors (HDs) and patients with atherosclerosis-related disease using the amplified luminescent proximity homogeneous assay-linked immunosorbent assay., RESULTS: The first screening using the protein array method identified death-inducer obliterator 1 (DIDO1), forkhead box J2 (FOXJ2), and cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF2) as the target antigens of serum IgG antibodies in patients with AIS. Then, we prepared various antigens including glutathione S-transferase-fused DIDO1 protein as well as peptides of the amino acids 297-311 of DIDO1, 426-440 of FOXJ2, and 607-621 of CPSF2 to examine serum antibody levels. Compared with HDs, a significant increase in antibody levels of the DIDO1 protein and peptide in patients with AIS, transient ischemic attack (TIA), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) but not in those with acute myocardial infarction and diabetes mellitus (DM). Serum anti-FOXJ2 antibody levels were elevated in most patients with atherosclerosis-related diseases, whereas serum anti-CPSF2 antibody levels were associated with AIS, TIA, and DM. Receiver operating characteristic curves showed that serum DIDO1 antibody levels were highly associated with CKD, and correlation analysis revealed that serum anti-FOXJ2 antibody levels were associated with hypertension. A prospective case-control study on ischemic stroke verified that the serum antibody levels of the DIDO1 protein and DIDO1, FOXJ2, and CPSF2 peptides showed significantly higher odds ratios with a risk of AIS in patients with the highest quartile than in those with the lowest quartile, indicating that these antibody markers are useful as risk factors for AIS., CONCLUSIONS: Serum antibody levels of DIDO1, FOXJ2, and CPSF2 are useful in predicting the onset of atherosclerosis-related AIS caused by kidney failure, hypertension, and DM, respectively.","Authors":"Hiwasa, Takaki; Wang, Hao; Goto, Ken-Ichiro; Mine, Seiichiro; Machida, Toshio; Kobayashi, Eiichi; Yoshida, Yoichi; Adachi, Akihiko; Matsutani, Tomoo; Sata, Mizuki; Yamagishi, Kazumasa; Iso, Hiroyasu; Sawada, Norie; Tsugane, Shoichiro; Kunimatsu, Mitoshi; Kamitsukasa, Ikuo; Mori, Masahiro; Sugimoto, Kazuo; Uzawa, Akiyuki; Muto, Mayumi; Kuwabara, Satoshi; Kobayashi, Yoshio; Ohno, Mikiko; Nishi, Eiichiro; Hattori, Akiko; Yamamoto, Masashi; Maezawa, Yoshiro; Kobayashi, Kazuki; Ishibashi, Ryoichi; Takemoto, Minoru; Yokote, Koutaro; Takizawa, Hirotaka; Kishimoto, Takashi; Matsushita, Kazuyuki; Kobayashi, Sohei; Nomura, Fumio; Arasawa, Takahiro; Kagaya, Akiko; Maruyama, Tetsuro; Matsubara, Hisahiro; Tomiita, Minako; Hamanaka, Shinsaku; Imai, Yushi; Nakagawa, Tomoo; Kato, Naoya; Terada, Jiro; Matsumura, Takuma; Katsumata, Yusuke; Naito, Akira; Tanabe, Nobuhiro; Sakao, Seiichiro; Tatsumi, Koichiro; Ito, Masaaki; Shiratori, Fumiaki; Sumazaki, Makoto; Yajima, Satoshi; Shimada, Hideaki; Shirouzu, Mikako; Yokoyama, Shigeyuki; Kudo, Takashi; Doi, Hirofumi; Iwase, Katsuro; Ashino, Hiromi; Li, Shu-Yang; Kubota, Masaaki; Tomiyoshi, Go; Shinmen, Natsuko; Nakamura, Rika; Kuroda, Hideyuki; Iwadate, Yasuo","Publisher":"BMC medicine","Issue":"1","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12916-021-02001-9","Pages":"131","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"antibodies anti-death-inducer obliterator 1 (DIDO1) & anti-forkhead box J2 (FOXJ2) & anti-cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF2)"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":3,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":1389,"Title":"C-reactive Protein for Stroke Detection in the Emergency Department in Patients With Dizziness Without Neurological Deficits","Year":2021,"Country":"","Abstract":"Background: Stroke diagnosis can be challenging in patients with dizziness without neurologic deficits. The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive value of C-reactive protein (CRP) for identifying acute stroke in such patients.

This was a cross-sectional study including 63 asymptomatic patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), with normal ECG and ejection fraction. Patients with any history of documented valvular, congestive or ischemic heart disease, renal or hepatic failure were excluded. At first all patients were interviewed and checked for risk factors and then patients underwent a two-day rest/stress 99mTc-MIBI gated MPI SPECT. Data was assessed by QPS/QGS and 4DM software and evaluated by a nuclear medicine specialist with summed stress score (SSS) of more than 4 defined as CAD. There were 42 females (67%) and 21 males (33%), with a mean age of 61.33 +/- 6.98 years and 7.97 +/- 4.86 years history of T2DM. CAD was detected in 26 (41.3%) patients and was significantly associated with male gender, smoking and requiring insulin therapy (P-value = 0.019, 0.046, 0.05, respectively). A significant association was found between the duration of diabetes, especially when > 15 years, and the probability of having CAD. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that smoking; male gender and diabetes duration were the strongest independent predictors of abnormal MPI results. We found a high (46%) prevalence of abnormal stress MPI SPECT in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, despite being asymptomatic. Asymptomatic patients with a history of smoking, long duration of diabetes, being under insulin treatment and male gender might benefit from MPI for early detection of silent ischemia.

The apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene polymorphism has been found to influence plasma lipid concentration, and its correlation with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) has been investigated. However, it is unclear whether ApoE is associated with PAD in Chinese type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. Therefore, our study is aimed at investigating the relationship between the ApoE gene polymorphism and PAD in Chinese T2DM patients. Methods. A total of 192 T2DM patients were divided into two groups: T2DM and T2DM with PAD. The clinical and biochemical parameters were obtained. Polymerase chain reaction was used to identify the genotypes of ApoE. The multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify the possible risk factor for PAD. Results. There were no significant differences in the genotype and allele frequencies of ApoE between the T2DM and T2DM with PAD groups. However, the T2DM with PAD group tended to have more 4/3 genotypes (21.5% vs. 11.3%) than the T2DM group. The multivariate logistic regression showed that smoking, age, disease duration, TG, LDL, and HbA1c were risk factors for PAD. Conclusions.

Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) detects carotid intraplaque neovascularization (IPN). The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that combining SE with carotid CEUS in patients with known or suspected CAD might provide incremental prognostic value beyond clinical risk factors and either test alone for the occurrence of cardiovascular events. Method(s): One hundred eighty-five patients (mean age, 69 +/- 8 years; 79% men) with known or suspected CAD referred for SE and found to have carotid plaque on screening were recruited for carotid CEUS imaging. IPN was graded by presence and location within plaque. Patients were followed for cardiovascular events (CVEs) including cardiac death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and transient ischemic attack or stroke. A subset of patients (n = 27) underwent carotid magnetic resonance imaging within 1 month of CEUS; carotid plaque was assessed for lipid-rich necrotic core, loose matrix, and presence of intraplaque hemorrhage. Result(s): Sixty-nine patients had abnormal findings on SE. IPN was identified in 112 patients; 52 patients had IPN localized to plaque shoulder (IPNS). Plaques with IPNS had larger lipid-rich necrotic cores and were more likely to have intraplaque hemorrhage. During follow-up (median, 31 months), 26 CVEs occurred. Multivariate Cox proportional-hazard analysis showed IPN and IPNS to be predictors of CVEs (hazard ratios, 3.34 [95% CI, 1.25-8.93; P =.02] and 4.88 [95% CI, 1.77-13.49; P =.002], respectively). The presence of IPNS increased the likelihood of CVEs beyond SE and history of CAD (chi2 = 9.0, P =.02). Conclusion(s): Carotid IPN detected by CEUS and localized to plaque shoulder was an independent predictor of CVEs in patients referred for SE.Copyright © 2020 American Society of Echocardiography","Authors":"Huang, R.; DeMarco, J.

Method(s): The diagnostic performance of TTE alone and combined with the aortic dissection risk score (ADRS) in TAAAD was evaluated. In this retrospective study (ChiCTR, No. 2000031291), TTE was reviewed to detect direct/indirect signs of TAAAD. The ADRS of each patient was calculated according to guidelines. Case adjudication was based on advanced imaging and surgery. Result(s): Among a total of 442 patients, TAAAD was diagnosed in 146 (33.0%).

Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios for incident CVD (coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, or heart failure hospitalization) and mortality across combined NT-proBNP and/or BP categories, adjusting for CVD risk factors., RESULTS: There were 9,309 participants (age: 62.6 +/- 5.6 years; 58.3% women) with 2,416 CVD events over a median follow-up of 16.7 years. Within each SBP, DBP, or PP category, a higher category of NT-proBNP (100 to <300 or 300 pg/ml, compared with NT-proBNP <100 pg/ml) was associated with a graded increased risk for CVD events and mortality. Participants with SBP 130 to 139 mm Hg but NT-proBNP >=300 pg/ml had a hazards ratio of 3.4 for CVD (95% confidence interval: 2.44 to 4.77) compared with a NT-proBNP of <100 pg/ml and SBP of 140 to 149 mm Hg., CONCLUSIONS: Elevated NT-proBNP is independently associated with CVD and mortality across SBP, DBP, and PP categories and helps identify subjects at the highest risk.

Routine phenotyping consists of electrocardiography (ECG) and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has become valuable in the work-up of HCM. In this study, we investigated the value of CMR in phenotyping of G+ family members. Methods and Results: This study included 91 G+ subjects who underwent ECG, TTE and CMR, with a maximal wall thickness (MWT) <15 mm on TTE. The relative performance of TTE and CMR regarding wall thickness measurements and HCM diagnoses was assessed. HCM was defined as MWT of >=13 mm. Logistic regression was performed to assess whether ECG and TTE parameters can predict CMR results. Most subjects (75%) had an MWT <13 mm on TTE, of which 23 (34%) were diagnosed with HCM based on CMR. MWT differences (range 1-10 mm) were often caused by an anterobasal hook-shaped thickening of the myocardium not visible on TTE. Two of 23 (9%) subjects with HCM on TTE were reclassified as no HCM on CMR. Normal ECG and TTE results almost excluded reclassifications by CMR. The prevalence of other HCM-related abnormalities on CMR was low. Conclusion(s): CMR reclassified 27% of subjects. Subjects with normal ECG/TTE results were reclassified in a low number of cases, justifying screening with ECG and TTE in G+ relatives. In subjects with abnormal ECGs and/or poor TTE image quality, CMR is indicated.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).","Authors":"Huurman, R.; Van Der Velde, N.; Schinkel, A. F. L.; Hassing, H.

We aimed to develop a deep learning algorithm to aid in the differentiation of common etiologies of LVH (i.e. hypertensive heart disease [HHD], hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [HCM], and light-chain cardiac amyloidosis [ALCA]) on echocardiographic images. Echocardiograms in 5 standard views (parasternal long-axis, parasternal short-axis, apical 4-chamber, apical 2-chamber, and apical 3-chamber) were obtained from 930 subjects: 112 with HHD, 191 with HCM, 81 with ALCA and 546 normal subjects. The study population was divided into training (n = 620), validation (n = 155), and test sets (n = 155). A convolutional neural network-long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) algorithm was constructed to independently classify the 3 diagnoses on each view, and the final diagnosis was made by an aggregate network based on the simultaneously predicted probabilities of HCM, HCM, and ALCA. Diagnostic performance of the algorithm was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and accuracy was evaluated by the confusion matrix. The deep learning algorithm was trained and verified using the training and validation sets, respectively. In the test set, the average AUC across the five standard views was 0.962, 0.982 and 0.996 for HHD, HCM and CA, respectively. The overall diagnostic accuracy was significantly higher for the deep learning algorithm (92.3%) than for echocardiography specialists (80.0% and 80.6%). In the present study, we developed a deep learning algorithm for the differential diagnosis of 3 common LVH etiologies (HHD, HCM and ALCA) by applying a hybrid CNN-LSTM model and aggregate network to standard echocardiographic images. The high diagnostic performance of our deep learning algorithm suggests that the use of deep learning can improve the diagnostic process in patients with LVH. Copyright © 2022.

Current screening methods are optimised to identify patients with a high risk of cardio-vascular disease, especially among the elderly. However, in young adults and children, these methods suffer low sensitivity and specificity and contribute to further delays in their triage and diagnosis. Accordingly, there is an urgent need to develop reliable blood biomarkers for triaging patients suspected of stroke in all age groups, especially children and young adults. This review explores some of the existing blood biomarkers, as single biomarkers or biomarker panels, and examines their sensitivity and specificity for predicting stroke. A review was performed on PubMed and Web of Science for journal articles published in English during the period 2001 to 2021, which contained information regarding biomarkers of stroke. In this review article, we provide comparative information on the availability, clinical usefulness, and time-window periods of seven single blood biomarkers and five biomarker panels that have been used for predicting stroke in emergency situations. The outcomes of this review can be used in future research for developing more effective stroke biomarkers.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.","Authors":"Jadav, R. K.; Mortazavi, R.; Yee, K.

Literature on CT angiography [CTA] to study plaque morphology is limited. We studied plaque characteristics of extracranial carotid arteries using CTA to ascertain the high risk features beyond luminal stenosis. Material(s) and Method(s): Retrospective study design, where patients with carotid territory ischemia who underwent CTA from January 2011 till December 2015 were recruited from medical records. CT images were reviewed for plaque characteristics like attenuation, ulceration, plaque thickness and presence of intraluminal thrombus [ILT] along with percentage stenosis. Result(s): 114 patients with 201 carotids [102 symptomatic and 99 asymptomatic] were reviewed. Mixed density plaques [p = 0.05], ulceration [p = 0.001], ILT [p = 0.004] and higher soft plaque thickness [p < 0.001] were significantly associated with symptomatic carotids whereas calcified plaques were seen in asymptomatic carotids [p = 0.005]. Plaque characteristics were comparable in symptomatic patients with moderate[50-69 %] and severe[70-99 %] stenosis. Multivariate analysis showed that increased soft plaque thickness remained significantly associated with symptomatic carotid. A cut-off value for soft plaque thickness of 2.75 mm could predict symptomatic carotid disease with a sensitivity of 85.2 % and specificity of 68.0 % [Youden's index]. An increase in soft plaque thickness of 4.0 mm significantly predicts change from asymptomatic to symptomatic carotid [p < 0.05]. Conclusion(s): Of the studied CTA plaque characteristics, soft plaque thickness is an independent predictor of symptomatic disease irrespective of the percentage stenosis. Soft plaque thickness over 2.75 mm and smallest detectable change[4 mm] are new measures to help ascertain the risk of ischemic events in carotid atherosclerotic disease.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Authors":"Jain, K.; Arun Prasad, B.; Sreedharan, S.

Method(s): Two types of ML-based setups called (i) AtheroRisk-integrated and (ii) AtheroRisk-conventional were developed using random forest (RF) classifiers. AtheroRisk-conventional uses a feature set of 13 CRF such as age, gender, hemoglobin A1c, fasting blood sugar, low-density lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol (TC), a ratio of TC and HDL, hypertension, smoking, family history, triglyceride, and ultrasound-based carotid plaque score. AtheroRisk-integrated system uses the feature set of 38 features with a combination of 13 CRF and 25 CUSIP features (6 types of current CUSIP, 6 types of 10-year CUSIP, 12 types of quadratic CUSIP (harmonics), and age-adjusted grayscale median). Logistic regression approach was used to select the significant features on which the RF classifier was trained. The performance of both ML systems was evaluated by area-under-the-curve (AUC) statistics computed using a leave-one-out cross-validation protocol. Result(s): Left and right common carotid arteries of 202 Japanese patients were retrospectively examined to obtain 404 ultrasound scans.

The detection of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM1), a cell surface immunoglobulin that amplifies pro-inflammatory responses, screened by bioinformatics was shown to be significant in diagnosing and predicting the prognosis of AMI. Method(s): GSE66360, GSE61144 and GSE60993 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to explore the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between AMI and control groups using R software. A total of 147 patients in total were prospectively enrolled from October 2018 to June 2019 and divided into two groups, the normal group (n = 35) and the AMI group (n = 112). Plasma was collected from each patient at admission and all patients received 6-month follow-up care. Result(s): According to bioinformatic analysis, TREM1 was an important DEG in patients with AMI. Compared with the normal group, TREM1 expression was markedly increased in the AMI group (p < 0.001). TREM1 expression was positively correlated with fasting plasma glucose (FPG), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbAC), and the number of lesion vessels, although it had no correlation with Gensini score. TREM1 expression in the triple-vessels group was significantly higher than that of the single-vessel group (p < 0.05). Multiple linear regression showed that UA and HbAC were two factors influencing TREM1 expression. The ROC curve showed that TREM1 had a diagnostic significance in AMI (p < 0.001), especially in AMI patients without diabetes. Cox regression showed increased TREM1 expression was closely associated with 6-month major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) (p < 0.001).

We investigated whether coronary artery disease (CAD) susceptible loci can be used to predict the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in a cohort with acute coronary syndromes (ACSs). A total of 1667 patients hospitalized with ACS were enrolled and prospectively followed for a median of 2 years. We constructed a weighted GRS comprising 79 CAD risk variants and investigated the association between GRS and MACE using a multivariable cox proportional hazard regression model. The incremental value of adding GRS into the prediction model was assessed by integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) and decision curve analysis (DCA). In the age- and sex-adjusted model, each increase in standard deviation in the GRS was associated with a 33% increased risk of MACE (hazard ratio: 1.33; 95% confidence interval: 1.10-1.61; P = 0.003), with this association not attenuating after further adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors. The addition of GRS to a prediction model of seven clinical risk factors and EPICOR prognostic model slightly improved risk stratification for MACE as calculated by IDI (+1.7%, P = 0.006; +0.3%, P = 0.024, respectively). DCA demonstrated positive net benefits by adding GRS to other models. GRS was associated with MACE after multivariable adjustment in a cohort comprising Chinese ACS patients. Future studies are needed to validate our results and further evaluate the predictive value of GRS in secondary prevention. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press.

At the baseline visit, participants underwent a clinical interview, a brain MRI, urine and blood sampling collection and vascular testing studies. Therefore, we obtained markers of TOD from the brain [white matter hyperintensities, silent brain infarcts (SBI), cerebral microbleeds and enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS)], from kidney (microalbuminuria, glomerular filtration) and regarding large vessels [ankle-to-brachial index (ABI), carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity].

We aimed to evaluate the association between IL-32 levels and coronary stenosis severity, IL-32 polymorphisms rs28372698 and rs4786370, and CAD susceptibility., METHODS: A total of 362 patients with definite or suspected CAD that underwent angiography were recruited (CAD group, n = 175; nonobstructive CAD group, n = 56; control group, n = 131). The severity of coronary stenosis was assessed using the Gensini score and the number of diseased vessels. IL-32 levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Gene polymorphisms were genotyped using PCR and sequencing techniques., RESULTS: IL-32 levels were significantly different at different levels of coronary artery stenosis (p < 0.05), and logIL-32 was positively correlated with the Gensini score (r = 0.357, p < 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that IL-32 was independently associated with CAD (OR = 6.526, 95% CI: 3.344-12.739, p < 0.01). The receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed the area under the curve for discriminating the CAD and Gensini score were 0.605 and 0.613, respectively. Furthermore, IL-32 levels were significantly higher before percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) than at 7 days post-PCI (p = 0.012). The homozygous TT genotype and T allele of rs28372698 were found to be associated with increased risk of CAD, while TT homozygosity and the T allele of rs4786370 with reduced risk of CAD (p < 0.05). However, both SNPs had no obvious effect on IL-32 levels or coronary stenosis severity in patients with CAD., CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to show that rs28372698 and rs4786370 are associated with CAD susceptibility in Chinese Han population. We also suggest that plasma IL-32 levels may be indicative of coronary artery stenosis and the efficacy of PCI and provide guidance for risk stratification and disease management.

We sought to evaluate the association between imaging parameters and 1-year stroke recurrence in patients with TIA or MIS in different risk stratum stratified by ABCD2score. Method(s): We included patients with TIA and MIS (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score <=3) with complete baseline vessel and brain imaging data from the Third China National Stroke Registry III. Patients were categorized into different risk groups based on ABCD2score (low risk, 0-3; moderate risk, 4-5; and high risk, 6-7). The primary outcome was stroke recurrence within 1 year. Multivariable Cox proportional-hazards regression models were used to assess whether imaging parameters (large artery stenosis, infarction number) were independently associated with stroke recurrence. Result(s): Of the 7140 patients included, 584 patients experienced stroke recurrence within 1 year. According to the ABCD2score, large artery stenosis was associated with higher stroke recurrence in both low-risk (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.746 [95% CI, 1.200-2.540]) and moderate-risk group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.326 [95% CI, 1.042-1.687]) but not in the high-risk group (P>0.05). Patients with multiple acute infarctions or single acute infarction had a higher risk of recurrent stroke than those with no infarction in both low- and moderate-risk groups, but not in the high-risk group. Conclusion(s): Large artery stenosis and infarction number were independent predictors of 1-year stroke recurrence in low-moderate risk but not in high-risk patients with TIA or MIS stratified by ABCD2score. This finding emphasizes the importance of early brain and vascular imaging evaluation for risk stratification in patients with TIA or MIS.Copyright © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Methods and Results In this prospective cohort (2017-2019), left ventricular/LA structure and function were quantified by 2-dimensional and speckle tracking echocardiography in 151 patients with stroke. Strain/strain rate curves for the 3 components of the LA cycle, ie, (1) Reservoir (global longitudinal strain [Srmax]), (2) Conductive (early LA Sr [Sre]), and (3) Active (late LA strain [Sra]) were evaluated, masked to stroke subtype.

In this notion, diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) remains a challenge in emergency department (ED). We aim to examine different approaches for rule-in and rule-out of ACS using risk scores, copeptin, and coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). A prospective observational study was designed to evaluate chest pain patients. Consecutive adult patients admitted to the ED with a chief complaint of chest pain due to any cause were included. All patients were followed-up for 6 months after discharge for major adverse cardiovascular events and readmissions. Admission data, ED processes, and diagnoses were analyzed. One hundred forty-six patients were included, average age was 63 +/- 13.4 years, and 95 (65.1%) were male. Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) and History, ECG, Age, Risk factors, Troponin (HEART) scores showed good prognostic abilities, but HEART combination with copeptin improves diagnoses of myocardial infarction (area under the curve [AUC] 0.764 vs AUC 0.864 P =.0008). Patients with elevated copeptin were older, had higher risk scores, and were more likely to be admitted to hospital and diagnosed with ACS in ED. For copeptin, AUC was 0.715 (95% confidence interval 0.629-0.803), and for combination with troponin, AUC of 0.770 (0.703-0.855) did not improve rule-in of myocardial infarction. High-sensitivity troponin I assay alongside prior stroke, history of carotid stenosis, dyslipidemia, use of diuretics, and electrocardiogram changes (left bundle branch block or ST depression) are good predictors of myocardial infarction (chi2 = 52.29, AUC = 0.875 [0.813-0.937], P <.001). The regression analysis showed that combination of copeptin and CCTA without significant stenosis can be used for ACS rule-out (chi2 = 26.36, P <.001, AUC = 0.772 [0.681-0.863], negative predictive value of 96.25%). For rule-in of ACS, practitioner should consider not only scores for risk stratification but carefully analyze medical history and nonspecific electrocardiogram changes and even with normal troponin results, we strongly suggest thorough evaluation in chest pain unit. For rule-out of ACS combination of copeptin and CCTA holds great potential.Copyright © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

We recruited 125 consecutive patients with embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS) and 125 patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation as controls. All participants underwent P wave SAECG at baseline, and patients with ESUS were followed up with Holter monitoring and electrocardiography at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months after discharge and every 6 months thereafter. In the ESUS group, 32 (25.6%) patients were diagnosed with SCAF during follow-up. There were no significant differences between the groups regarding atrial substrate. P wave duration (PWD) was a significant predictor of SCAF. Stroke recurrence occurred in 22 patients (17.6%), and prolonged PWD (>= 135 ms) predicted stroke recurrence more robustly than SCAF detection. In ESUS patients, PWD can be a useful biomarker to predict SCAF and to identify patients who are more likely to have a recurrent embolic stroke associated with an atrial cardiopathy.

We performed global metabolomics profiling and network analysis on blood samples from the Wonju and Pyeongchang (WP) cohort study (n = 2055) to elucidate the importance of purine related metabolites associated with potential CAD risk. Then, 5 selected serum metabolites were quantified from the WP cohort, Shinchon cohort (n = 259), and Shinchon case control (n = 424) groups to develop machine learning models for 10-year risk prediction, relapse within 10 years and diagnosis of the disease via 100 repeated 5-fold cross-validations of logistic models. The combination of purine metabolite levels or only xanthine levels in blood could be applied for machine learning model development for major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular event (MACCE, cerebrovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, coronary artery bypass graft, and stroke) risk prediction, relapse of MACCEs among patients with myocardial infarction history and diagnosis of stable CAD. In particular, our research provided initial evidence that blood xanthine and uric acid levels play different roles in the development of machine learning models for primary/secondary prevention or diagnosis of CAD. In this research, we determined that purine-related metabolites in blood are applicable to machine learning model development for CAD risk prediction and diagnosis. Also, our work advances current CAD biomarker discovery strategies mainly relying on clinical features; emphasizes the differential biomarkers in first/secondary prevention or diagnosis studies.Copyright © 2021","Authors":"Jung, S.; Ahn, E.; Koh, S.

In the present cross-sectional study, we investigated whether the plasma nesfatin-1 and DPP4 is associated with the prevalence and severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) with and without diabetes mellitus (DM)., METHODS: We consecutively enrolled a total of 240 patients with significant CAD (previous revascularization or angiographically-proven coronary artery stenosis > 50%) presented with either unstable angina (UA, N = 76) or stable chronic CAD (SCAD, N = 165). 85 patients with at least 2 classical cardiovascular risk factors but without significant CAD served as controls. The severity of CAD was assessed using coronary angiography by the Gensini score. Clinical parameters, glycemic and lipid profile, high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP), nesfatin-1 and DPP4 levels were assayed., RESULTS: No differences were found for age, sex, hypertension and diabetes distribution between groups. Low nesfatin-1 levels were found in both CAD groups (UA & SCAD) with respect to controls. The difference between UA and SCAD groups was marginally non-significant. There was a significant increase of DPP4 along UA to SCAD and control groups. Differences between groups remained unchanged in non-diabetic participants. Nesfatin-1 significantly correlated to hsCRP (r = - 0.287, p = 0.036), HOMA-IR (r = - 0.587, p = 0.007) and hyperlipidemia (r = - 0.331, p = 0.034). DPP4 was significantly associated with hs-CRP (r = 0.353 p < 0.001) and FPG (r = 0.202, p = 0.020) in univariate analysis, but those correlations were lost in multiple regression analysis. There was a negative correlation between nesfatin-1 and the severity of CAD, quantified by the Gensini score (r = - 0.511, p < 0.001), but no association was found for DPP4., CONCLUSIONS: Serum DPP4 levels are increased in patients with CAD, while serum nesfatin-1 levels have a negative association with both the incidence and the severity of CAD. These results are independent of the presence of diabetes mellitus. In addition, both peptides have a strong association with hsCRP. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00306176.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 levels were recently found to be increased in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists improve cardiovascular outcomes in patients with diabetes. The aim of this study was to assess the predictive capacity of GLP-1 serum levels for cardiovascular outcome in patients with myocardial infarction. Methods In 918 patients presenting with myocardial infarction [321 ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and 597 and results non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)] total GLP-1, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels and the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) score were assessed at time of hospital admission. The primary composite outcome of the study was the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke. Kaplan-Meier survival plots and univariable Cox regression analyses found GLP-1 to be associated with adverse outcome [hazard ratio (HR) of logarithmized GLP-1 values: 6.29, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.67-14.81; P < 0.0001]. After further adjustment for age, sex, family history of cardiovascular disease, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterinaemia, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) CKD-EPI, hs-CRP, hs-Troponin T, and NT-proBNP levels the HR remained significant at 10.98 (95% CI: 2.63-45.90; P = 0.0010). Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve analyses illustrated that GLP-1 levels are a strong indicator for early events. For events up to 30 days after admission, GLP-1 proved to be superior to other biomarkers including hs-Troponin T, GFR CKD-EPI, hs-CRP, and NT-proBNP. Adjustment of the GRACE risk estimate by addition of GLP-1 increased the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve over time in NSTEMI patients. Conclusion In patients hospitalized for myocardial infarction, GLP-1 levels are associated with cardiovascular events.Copyright Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

Its dynamic release kinetics may enable a 0/1h-decision algorithm that is even more effective than the ESC hs-cTnT/I 0/1 h rule-in/rule-out algorithm., METHODS AND RESULTS: In a prospective international diagnostic study enrolling patients presenting with suspected NSTEMI to the emergency department, cMyC was measured at presentation and after 1 h in a blinded fashion. Modelled on the ESC hs-cTnT/I 0/1h-algorithms, we derived a 0/1h-cMyC-algorithm. Final diagnosis of NSTEMI was centrally adjudicated according to the 4th Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction. Among 1495 patients, the prevalence of NSTEMI was 17%. The optimal derived 0/1h-algorithm ruled-out NSTEMI with cMyC 0 h concentration below 10 ng/L (irrespective of chest pain onset) or 0 h cMyC concentrations below 18 ng/L and 0/1 h increase <4 ng/L. Rule-in occurred with 0 h cMyC concentrations of at least 140 ng/L or 0/1 h increase >=15 ng/L. In the validation cohort (n = 663), the 0/1h-cMyC-algorithm classified 347 patients (52.3%) as 'rule-out', 122 (18.4%) as 'rule-in', and 194 (29.3%) as 'observe'. Negative predictive value for NSTEMI was 99.6% [95% confidence interval (CI) 98.9-100%]; positive predictive value 71.1% (95% CI 63.1-79%).

Previous studies have described the astroglial protein GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) as a biomarker of intracerebral hemorrhage. The aim of this study was to test the diagnostic accuracy of GFAP for ruling out intracranial hemorrhage in a prospective cohort of Indian stroke patients. Patients and Methods: This study was conducted in an Indian tertiary hospital (Christian Medical College, Ludhiana). Patients with symptoms suggestive of acute stroke admitted within 12 h of symptom onset were enrolled. Blood samples were collected at hospital admission. Single Molecule Array technology was used for determining serum GFAP concentrations. Result(s): A total number of 155 patients were included (70 intracranial hemorrhage, 75 ischemic stroke, 10 stroke mimics). GFAP serum concentrations were elevated in intracranial hemorrhage patients compared to ischemic stroke patients [median (interquartile range) 2.36 microg/L (0.61-7.16) vs. 0.18 microg/L (0.11-0.38), p < 0.001]. Stroke mimics patients had a median GFAP serum level of 0.14 microg/L (0.09-0.26). GFAP values below the cut-off of 0.33 microg/L (area under the curve 0.871) ruled out intracranial hemorrhage with a negative predictive value of 89.7%, (at a sensitivity for detecting intracranial hemorrhage of 90.0%). Discussion(s): The high negative predictive value of a GFAP test system allows ruling out patients with intracranial hemorrhage. Conclusion(s): In settings where immediate brain imaging is not available, this would enable to implement secondary prevention (e.g., aspirin) in suspected ischemic stroke patients as soon as possible.Copyright © European Stroke Organisation 2021.","Authors":"Kalra, L.

This is explained by the limited availability and the high cost of standard vascular imaging techniques. Neurovascular ultrasound is portable, cheaper and non-invasive and could, therefore, represent a reasonable alternative to fill this knowledge gap. We explored the feasibility of neurovascular ultrasound in Malawian adults with acute stroke-like syndrome to inform the design of future large stroke studies comparing its diagnostic performance to that of gold standard vascular imaging techniques in sub-Saharan Africa., METHODS: We enrolled consecutive patients diagnosed with acute stroke-like syndrome based on the World Health Organization definition. Clinical and demographic data were recorded, and a comprehensive neurovascular ultrasound was performed. Fisher's exact and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to study the relationship between atherosclerosis and potential risk factors., RESULTS: Sixty-six patients were enrolled (mean age: 58.7 years). The frequency of extracranial atherosclerosis was 39.4% (n = 26, 95% CI: 28.6-52.2). There were 12 patients with abnormal carotid intima media thickness (18.2%, 95% CI: 9.8-29.6) and 14 patients with a carotid plaque (21.2%, 95% CI: 12.1-33.0).

Biomarker profiling emerges as a promising tool for the early diagnosis and risk stratification of either DM or CAD. However, studies assessing the predictive capacity of novel metabolomics biomarkers in coexistent CAD and DM are scarce. Method(s): This post-hoc analysis of the CorLipid trial (NCT04580173) included 316 patients with CAD and comorbid DM who underwent emergency or elective coronary angiography due to acute or chronic coronary syndrome. Cox regression analyses were performed to identify metabolomic predictors of the primary outcome, which was defined as the composite of major adverse cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events (MACCE: cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, major bleeding), repeat unplanned revascularizations and cardiovascular hospitalizations. Linear regression analyses were also performed to detect significant predictors of CAD complexity, as assessed by the SYNTAX score. Result(s): After a median 2-year follow up period (IQR = 0.7 years), the primary outcome occurred in 69 (21.8%) of patients. Acylcarnitine ratio C4/C18:2, apolipoprotein (apo) B, history of heart failure (HF), age > 65 years and presence of acute coronary syndrome were independent predictors of the primary outcome in diabetic patients with CAD (aHR = 1.89 [1.09, 3.29]; 1.02 [1.01, 1.04]; 1.28 [1.01, 1.41]; 1.04 [1.01, 1.05]; and 1.12 [1.05-1.21], respectively). Higher levels of ceramide ratio C24:1/C24:0, acylcarnitine ratio C4/C18:2, age > 65 and peripheral artery disease were independent predictors of higher CAD complexity (adjusted beta = 7.36 [5.74, 20.47]; 3.02 [0.09 to 6.06]; 3.02 [0.09, 6.06], respectively), while higher levels of apoA1 were independent predictors of lower complexity (adjusted beta= - 0.65 [- 1.31, - 0.02]). Conclusion(s): In patients with comorbid DM and CAD, novel metabolomic biomarkers and metabolomics-based prediction models could be recruited to predict clinical outcomes and assess the complexity of CAD, thereby enabling the integration of personalized medicine into routine clinical practice. These associations should be interpreted taking into account the observational nature of this study, and thus, larger trials are needed to confirm its results and validate them in different and larger diabetic populations.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s).","Authors":"Karagiannidis, E.; Moysidis, D.

Primary endpoints were combined all-cause death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, unstable angina, and ischemia-driven coronary revascularization. Secondary endpoint was all-cause death., RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 3.7 years. Overall, 1415 patients were evaluated retrospectively. No significant among-group differences were noted in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels over time (p = 0.44).

In the pooled cohorts, we investigated the SCAIL score to discriminate recurrent stroke after the index stroke/transient ischemic attack, after positron emission tomography-imaging, and in mild or moderate stenosis. Results-In the derivation cohort (109 patients), recurrent stroke risk increased with increasing SCAIL score (P=0.002, C statistic 0.71 [95% CI, 0.56-0.86]). The adjusted (age, sex, smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, antiplatelets, and statins) hazard ratio per 1-point SCAIL increase was 2.4 (95% CI, 1.2-4.5, P=0.01). Findings were confirmed in the validation cohort (87 patients, adjusted hazard ratio, 2.9 [95% CI, 1.9-5], P<0.001; C statistic 0.77 [95% CI, 0.67-0.87]). The SCAIL score independently predicted recurrent stroke after positron emission tomography-imaging (adjusted hazard ratio, 4.52 [95% CI, 1.58-12.93], P=0.005). Compared with stenosis severity (C statistic, 0.63 [95% CI, 0.46-0.80]), prediction of post-positron emission tomography stroke recurrence was improved with the SCAIL score (C statistic, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.66-0.97], P=0.04). Findings were confirmed in mild or moderate stenosis (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.74 [95% CI, 1.39-5.39], P=0.004). Conclusions-The SCAIL score improved the identification of early recurrent stroke. Randomized trials are needed to test if a combined stenosis-inflammation strategy improves selection for carotid revascularization where benefit is currently uncertain.Copyright © 2020 American Heart Association, Inc.","Authors":"Kelly, P.

Partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), along with univariate analysis using a false discovery rate (FDR) of q=0.05 were performed to discriminate metabolic profiles and to determine significantly different metabolites between healthy control and AMI risk groups., RESULTS: PLS-DA significantly separated the AMI risk sera from control sera. The metabolites associated with amino acid biosynthesis, 2-oxocarboxylic acid, tryptophan, and amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism pathways were mainly elevated in patients at risk of AMI. Further validation and quantification by MS/MS showed that tryptophan, carnitine, L-homocysteine sulfinic acid (L-HCSA), and cysteic acid (CA) were upregulated, while L-cysteine and L-cysteine sulfinic acid (L-CSA) were downregulated, specifically among AMI risk sera. Additionally, these discriminant metabolic profiles were not related to hypertension, smoking or alcoholism., CONCLUSION: In conclusion, detecting upregulated L-HCSA and CA along with carnitine among patients at risk for AMI could serve as promising non-invasive biomarkers for early AMI detection.

However, few studies have described the association between CAC and SCVDs. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the clinical relationship between CAC and SCVDs in a healthy Japanese male population. Method(s): In this observational study, 709 men, free of stroke, were sampled from a city in Japan from 2010 to 2014. CAC was scored using the Agatston method. The following SCVDs were assessed using magnetic resonance imaging: intracranial arterial stenosis (ICAS), lacunar infarction, deep and subcortical white matter hyperintensity (DSWMH), periventricular hyperintensity (PVH), and microbleeds. The participants were categorized according to CAC scores as follows: no CAC (0), mild CAC (1-100), and moderate-to-severe CAC (100). The adjusted odds ratios of prevalent SCVDs were computed in reference to the no-CAC group using logistic regression. Result(s): The mean (standard deviation) age of the participants was 68 (8.4) years. Participants in the moderate-to-severe CAC category showed significantly higher odds of prevalent lacunar infarction, DSWMH, and ICAS in age-adjusted and risk-factor-adjusted models. Microbleeds and PVH, in contrast, did not show any significant associations. The trends for CAC with lacunar infarction, DSWMH, and ICAS were also significant (all P-values for trend <= 0.02). Conclusion(s): Higher CAC scores were associated with higher odds of lacunar infarction, DSWMH, and ICAS. The presence and degree of CAC may be a useful indicator for SCVDs involving small and large vessels.Copyright © 2020 Japan Atherosclerosis Society.","Authors":"Khan, M. M.

There is a high incidence of AF recurrence despite the treatment. The aim of the study was to assess the time to recurrence of AF after sinus rhythm restoration with electrical or pharmacological cardioversion and to identify the risk factors., METHODS: This study included 101 patients with AF (56% females) at a mean age of 68.02+/-7 years, after sinus rhythm restoration in a clinical observation of 1-year placebo-controlled treatment with spironolactone (1: 1). The patients were analyzed on the basis of AF recurrence, hospitalization, demographic parameters, comorbidities, embolic risk, and value of biomarker galectin-3 (Gal-3)., RESULTS: The average number of AF recurrences was1.62 per patient per year. The median time of occurrence of at least one new episode was 48 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) 14.24-81.76. Female patients experienced significantly more recurrences than male-53.3% vs. 28.6% hazard ration (HR) =1.76, 95% CI 1.02-3.03, p=0.036. The recurrences were more common with increased age, although not significantly. Patients with arterial hypertension had a threefold risk of recurrences than those without hypertension (p=0.025), independently of the treatment. CHA2DS2-VASc score was significantly associated with AF recurrent episodes. Patients with gout had a twofold increased risk, without statistical significance (p=0.15). There was no difference in the AF episodes according to treatment with spironolactone. The levels of Gal-3 did not affect the number of AF recurrences (p=0.9)., CONCLUSION: AF is associated with frequent recurrences after restoration of sinus rhythm in the majority of the patients. Most of them occurred within the first 3 months. Female sex, arterial hypertension, and CHA2DS2-VASc score were significant predictors of AF recurrence. Spironolactone did not reduce AF recurrences.","Authors":"Kisheva, Antoniya; Yotov, Yoto","Publisher":"Anatolian journal of cardiology","Issue":"5","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.14744/AnatolJCardiol.2020.80914","Pages":"338-345","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"CHA2DS2-VASc  & female & arterial hypertension"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":6,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":8,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":1802,"Title":"Soluble ST2 as a Potential Biomarker for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms-A Single-Center Retrospective Cohort Study","Year":2022,"Country":"","Abstract":"The maximal aortic diameter is the only clinically applied predictor of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) progression and indicator for surgical repair. Circulating biomarkers resulting from AAA pathogenesis are attractive candidates for the diagnosis and prognosis of aneurysmal disease. Due to the reported role of interleukin 33 in AAA development, we investigated the corresponding circulating receptor molecules of soluble suppression of tumorigenesis 2 (sST2) in AAA patients regarding their marker potential in diagnosis and prognosis. We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study in a diagnostic setting, measuring the circulating serum sST2 protein levels of 47 AAA patients under surveillance, matched with 25 peripheral artery disease (PAD) patients and 25 healthy controls. In a prognostic setting, we analyzed the longitudinal monitoring data of 50 monitored AAA patients. Slow versus fast AAA progression was defined as a <2 or >=2 mm increase in AAA diameter over 6 months and a <4 or >=4 mm increase over 12 months. Additionally, the association of circulating serum sST2 and AAA growth was investigated using a specifically tailored log-linear mixed model. Serum sST2 concentrations were significantly increased in AAA patients compared with healthy individuals: the median of AAA patient cohort was 112.72 ng/mL (p = 0.025) and that of AAA patient cohort 2 was 14.32 ng/mL (p = 0.039) versus healthy controls (8.82 ng/mL). Likewise, PAD patients showed significantly elevated sST2 protein levels compared with healthy controls (the median was 12.10 ng/mL; p = 0.048) but similar concentrations to AAA patients. Additionally, sST2 protein levels were found to be unsuited to identifying fast AAA progression over short-term periods of 6 or 12 months, which was confirmed by a log-linear mixed model. In conclusion, the significantly elevated protein levels of sST2 detected in patients with vascular disease may be useful in the early diagnosis of AAA but cannot distinguish between AAA and PAD or predict AAA progression.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.","Authors":"Klopf, J.; Demyanets, S.; Brekalo, M.; Eilenberg, W.; Wojta, J.; Neumayer, C.; Brostjan, C.; Stojkovic, S.","Publisher":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","Issue":"17","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms23179598","Pages":"9598","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"soluble suppression of tumorigenesis 2 (sST2)"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":24,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":1810,"Title":"Comparison of choroidal thicknesses in patients with coronary artery disease and patients at risk of coronary artery disease","Year":2021,"Country":"","Abstract":"PURPOSE: The study aimed to compare choroidal thicknesses (CTh) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and patients at risk of coronary artery disease and investigate whether thinning of the choroid can be used as a biomarker for development of coronary artery disease in patients at risk., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study group was composed of 103 eyes of 53 patients with coronary artery disease, and the control group was composed of 62 eyes of 32 patients with diabetes mellitus, hypertension and/or hyperlipidemia without coronary artery disease. CAD was diagnosed in patients with one of the following: myocardial infarction with/without ST segment elevation, clinically proven history of cardiac catheterization testifying greater than 50% obstruction in at least one coronary artery, revascularization operations. The control group consisted of clinically proven patients with normal coronary arteries. The choroidal thickness was measured with enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography under the fovea and at six other points, located at 500 micron, 1000 micron and 1500 micron nasal to the fovea and 500 micron, 1000 micron, 1500 micron temporal to the fovea., RESULTS: The subfoveal choroidal thickness was significantly thinner in the coronary artery disease group compared to the control group (244 microm vs. 289 microm; p < 0,001). In all other measured regions (nasal 500, nasal 1000, nasal 1500, temporal 500, temporal 1000, and temporal 1500 micron), CTh was statistically significant thinner in the CAD group. A negative significant linear relationship (low level) between CAD duration and choroidal thickness in the subfoveal, nasal 1000, nasal 1500, temporal 500, temporal 1000 micron regions was detected., CONCLUSION: Patients with CAD have a decreased choroidal thickness compared to patients at risk of CAD. Detection of CTh thinning in a patient with diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension and/or hypercholesterolemia, which pose a risk for CAD may be a predictor of development of coronary artery disease.

Method(s): ATP-stress CTP and CFVR were performed in 50 patients with stable angina pectoris. Myocardial ischemia assessed from CTP imaging was defined as qualitative visual perfusion defects and reduced myocardial blood flow (MBF) based on quantitative assessment. A cut-off value of CFVR of 2.0 was used. Result(s): The mean CFVR was 1.9 +/- 0.6 in ischemic regions by CTP, whereas it was 2.9 +/- 0.8 in non-ischemic regions (p < 0.001). CTP imaging could accurately predict CFVR <2.0 with 84.0% diagnostic accuracy (94.7% sensitivity, 77.4% specificity, 72.0% positive predictive value, and 96.0% negative predictive value). When receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of the MBF data was performed to detect CFVR <2.0, the area under the curve was 0.89, and the optimal MBF cut-off value was 1.43 mL/g/min.

Objective(s): This prospective, observational study investigated serum levels of hs-CRP and the activity of Lp-PLA2 in patients with sICAD in predicting the risk of long-term stroke recurrence. Method(s): We enrolled 48 patients with sICAD at 3 months from onset. The demographics, clini-cal, and imaging characteristics were recorded. Serum hs-CRP and Lp-PLA2 activity were as-sessed using automated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein assay and photometric technique, respec-tively. Patients were followed up at 6 months and 1 year and the presence of new vascular events was recorded. Result(s): The mean age of our study population was 59.5 +/- 10.3 years and 91.7% were men. Four patients developed recurrent strokes during follow-up. The mean Hs-CRP was elevated in patients with events than in patients without events (5.9 +/- 10.4 mg/L vs. 1.7 +/- 2.4 mg/L, P=0.03). However, there was no significant association of mean Lp-PLA2 activity (118.3+/-42.9 nmol/min/ml vs. 111.9 +/- 34.2 nmol/min/ml, P=0.73) with recurrence.

Insufficient activation of MGP leads to increased levels of undercarboxylated forms of MGP, measured as a dephosphorylated, undercarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP) in plasma. This study aimed to investigate whether the level of inactivated MGP influenced the risk of having an AAA, the risk of AAA progression, and overall mortality. Method(s): This combined case control and cohort study was based on data from the randomised, clinically controlled Viborg Vascular (VIVA) screening trial. Cases (n = 487) with an AAA and controls (n = 189) with neither peripheral artery disease nor AAA, had their plasma quantified for dp-ucMGP. Plasma levels were compared with the presence of an AAA, AAA growth rate, need for repair, and overall mortality. dp-ucMGP was divided into tertiles in regression analyses. Result(s): The plasma levels of dp-ucMGP were higher for AAA cases compared with controls (median of 517 pmol/L vs. 495 pmol/L, p = .036). Adjusted analyses regarding dp-ucMGP being predictive of AAA, AAA growth rate, and need for repair all failed to show correlation. Overall mortality for AAA cases exhibited a significant association for the third tertile of dp-ucMGP with a hazard ratio of 2.55 (95% CI 1.29 - 5.05) compared with the first tertile. Overall mortality for controls was not correlated with dp-ucMGP plasma levels. Conclusion(s): dp-ucMGP did not correlate with the risk of having an AAA, AAA growth rate, or risk of surgery. For people with an AAA, dp-ucMGP was correlated with an increased mortality risk for the highest tertile of dp-ucMGP. This could suggest a role for prophylactic measures with vitamin K2 supplements to people at risk of AAA.Copyright © 2021 European Society for Vascular Surgery","Authors":"Kristensen, J. S.

We hypothesise that commercially available genetic assays may provide additional information on hereditary cardiovascular risk in a timely and cost-efficient manner. Method(s): In a cohort of 51 patients treated for coronary artery disease (CAD) at University Hospital Heidelberg, Germany, a subgroup of patients with \"unstable\" CAD (i.e. recurrent acute coronary syndrome) was identified and compared to patients with \"stable\" disease (i.e. chronic coronary syndrome). Gene array analysis using a commercial assay for 15 potentially pathogenic polymorphisms revealed our cohort's genetic risk profile regarding atherosclerotic/thromboembolic events. Improvement of cardiovascular risk assessment based on established risk scores was analysed using net reclassification, logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Result(s): Discriminatory capacity of traditional risk scores such as SCORE2 or PROCAM with regard to stable and unstable CAD groups was poor (ROC AUC <0.5). Patients with \"unstable\" CAD exhibited a significantly increased frequency of pathogenic eNOS 894 T and MTHFR 1298 C polymorphisms compared to \"stable\" CAD patients, and information on these polymorphisms individually as well as combinations with additional polymorphisms included in the assay such as ACE D/D or PAI-1 5 G variants markedly improved risk prediction compared to SCORE2/PROCAM alone (ROC AUC >=0.75).

The aim of this study was to identify a novel antibody in patients with ischemic stroke by serological identification of antigens using recombinant cDNA expression cloning from patients who had a transient ischemic attack (TIA). We identified the serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade E member 1 (SERPINE1), as a candidate antigen. The serum anti-SERPINE1 antibody levels quantified using amplified luminescent proximity homogeneous assay-linked immunosorbent assay were significantly higher in patients with ischemic stroke, including those with acute cerebral infarction (aCI), TIA, and chronic cerebral infarction, than in healthy donors. The antibody levels were strongly associated with old age, female sex, and presence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease. Age and intima-media thickness of the carotid artery were positively correlated with antibody levels, which suggests that SERPINE1 may reflect the progression of atherosclerosis. In a multivariate analysis, SERPINE1 antibody level was an independent predictor of aCI. Thus, the serum levels of anti-SERPINE1 antibody could potentially serve as a biomarker of atherothrombotic infarction. Copyright © 2021.

We tested the hypothesis that LA fibrosis, quantified using late-gadolinium-enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (LGE-MRI), predicts recurrent stroke or atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with ESUS. Method(s): We compared atrial fibrosis in healthy controls and patients with lacunar stroke, ESUS, and known AF with or without prior stroke. We followed patients with ESUS prospectively for the primary outcome of recurrent ischemic stroke, incident AF, or both. Result(s): We enrolled 203 patients from three centers: 103 patients without AF (35 healthy controls, 15 with lacunar strokes, 53 with ESUS) and 100 patients with AF (50 with and 50 without prior stroke). Patients with ESUS had significantly higher atrial fibrosis (15.0 +/- 6.2%) compared to healthy controls (8.1 +/- 7.9%; <0.0001) and compared to lacunar stroke patients (10.8 +/- 8.4; p = 0.02), but had comparable fibrosis to patients with AF with (17.9 +/- 11.4%) or without prior stroke (16.6 +/- 9.2%; p = NS for both). Over a mean follow-up of 19 months, nine of 53 patients (16.9%) with ESUS experienced the combined primary outcome, which included six patients (11.3%) with recurrent ischemic stroke and five patients with incident AF (9.4%). Patients with ESUS with fibrosis >=12% had a higher proportion of the combined outcome: 25.0% vs. 4.8%; p = 0.039. Conclusion(s): Patients with ESUS demonstrate atrial fibrosis comparable to that seen in AF. Atrial fibrosis >=12% was associated with recurrent stroke, incident AF or both. This subgroup of ESUS patients may benefit from anticoagulation for secondary prevention of ischemic stroke.Copyright © 2021 European Academy of Neurology","Authors":"Kuhnlein, P.; Mahnkopf, C.; Majersik, J.

Hence, this presented work leverages the ability of a pretrained deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for the detection of ICH in computed tomography (CT) brain images. Method(s): Different frameworks have been analyzed for their effectiveness for the classification of CT brain images into hemorrhage or non-hemorrhage conditions. All these frameworks were investigated on the CQ500 dataset. Furthermore, an exclusive preprocessing pipeline was designed for both normal and ICH CT images. Firstly, a framework involving the pretrained deep CNN, AlexNet, has been exploited for both feature extraction and classification using the transfer learning method. Secondly, a modified AlexNet-Support vector machine (SVM) classifier is explored, and finally, a feature selection method, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), has been introduced in the AlexNet-SVM classifier model, and its efficacy is also explored. These models were trained and tested on two different sets of CT images, one containing the original images without prepro-cessing and another set consisting of preprocessed images. Result(s): The modified AlexNet-SVM classifier has shown an improved performance in comparison to the other investigated frameworks and has achieved a classification accuracy of 99.86% and sensitivity and specificity of 0.9986 for the detection of ICH in the brain CT images. Conclusion(s): This research has given an overview of a simple and efficient framework for the classification of hemorrhage and non-hemorrhage images. The proposed simplified deep learning framework also manifests its ability as a screening tool to assist the radiological trainees in the accurate detection of ICH.Copyright © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.","Authors":"Kumaravel, P.; Mohan, S.; Arivudaiyanambi, J.; Shajil, N.; Venkatakrishnan, H.

We aimed to create a model to predict MVD using a combination of quantitative MPI values and background factors of patients. We also assessed whether patients in the same database could be selected who do not require rest studies (stress-only imaging)., METHODS: We analyzed data from 1001 patients who had been assessed by stress MPI at 12 centers and 463 patients who had not undergone revascularization in Japan. Quantitative values based on MPI were obtained using cardioREPO software, which included myocardial perfusion defect scores, left ventricular ejection fractions and volumes. Factors in MPI and clinical backgrounds that could predict MVD were investigated using univariate and multivariate analyses. We also investigated whether stress data alone could predict patients without coronary stenosis to identify candidates for stress-only imaging., RESULTS: We selected summed stress score (SSS), rest end-diastolic volume, and hypertension to create a predictive model for MVD. A logistic regression model was created with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.825. To more specifically predict coronary three-vessel disease, the AUC was 0.847 when SSS, diabetes, and hypertension were selected. The mean probabilities of abnormality based on the MVD prediction model were 12%, 24%, 40%, and 51% for no-, one-, two-, and three-vessel disease, respectively (p < 0.0001). For the model to select patients with stress-only imaging, the AUC was 0.78 when the model was created using SSS, stress end-systolic volume and the number of risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and a history of smoking)., CONCLUSION: A model analysis combining myocardial SPECT and clinical data can predict MVD, and can select patients for stress-only tests. Our models should prove useful for clinical applications. Copyright © 2022.

The concern for the medical welfare of the elderly is increasing due to a low birth rate, an aging population, and the lack of medical personnel. The demand for services that take user age, cognitive capacity, and difficulty into account is rising. As a result, there is an increased demand for smart healthcare systems that can lower hospital admissions and offer patients individualized care. This has motivated us to develop an AI system that can easily screen and manage neurological diseases through videos. As neurological diseases can be diagnosed by visual analysis to some extent, in this study, we set out to estimate the possibility of a person having a neurological disease from videos. Among neurological diseases, we focus on stroke because it is a common condition in the elderly population and results in high mortality and morbidity worldwide. The proposed method consists of three steps: (1) transforming neurological examination videos into landmark data, (2) converting the landmark data into recurrence plots, and (3) estimating the possibility of a stroke using deep neural networks. Major features, such as the hand, face, pupil, and body movements of a person are extracted from test videos taken under several neurological examination protocols using deep-learning-based landmark extractors. Sequences of these landmark data are then converted into recurrence plots, which can be interpreted as images. These images can be fed into convolutional neural networks to classify stroke using feature-fusion techniques. A case study of the application of a disease screening test to assess the capability of the proposed method is presented.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.","Authors":"Lee, T.; Jeon, E. T.; Jung, J.

This study aimed to determine the prevalence and clinical predictors of coronary artery calcium (CAC) score, and evaluate the CAC score as a predictor of cardiovascular outcome in a large asymptomatic T2DM cohort., METHODS: A total of 2,162 T2DM patients were recruited from a Diabetes Shared Care Network and the CAC score was measured. Cardiovascular outcomes were obtained for 1,928 patients after a follow-up of 8.4 years. Multiple regression analysis and Cox proportional hazard regression were applied to identify clinical predictors of CAC and calculate the incidence and hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events by CAC category., RESULTS: Of the recruited patients, 96.8% had one or more risk factors. The distribution of CAC scores was as follows: CAC=0 in 24.2% of the patients, 0 <CAC <= 100 in 41.5%, 100 <CAC <= 400 in 20.3%, CAC >400 in 14.7%. The multivariable predictor of increased CAC included age (years) (odds ratio, 1.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.08), male sex (1.82; 1.54-2.17), duration (years) of T2DM (1.07; 1.05-1.09), and multiple risk factors (1.94; 1.28-2.95).

In order to improve our understanding of the risk factors associated with IS, we investigated the combined effect of the methylation of five genes related to the metabolism of homocysteine on developing IS., METHODS: Quantitative methylation-specific PCR was used to measure the levels of promoter methylation in hypertensive and stroke patients. The cutoff value calculated by the maximum Youden index was used to classify the levels of gene methylation as hypomethylation and hypermethylation. Logistic regression was used to explore the relationship between gene methylation and IS., RESULTS: The methylation levels of the genes encoding methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1 [MTHFD1], cystathionine beta-synthase [CBS], and dihydrofolate reductase [DHFR] in hypertensive patients were higher than those in stroke patients (all p < 0.01). MTHFD1 hypermethylation, CBS hypermethylation, and DHFR hypermethylation were protective factors for stroke after adjustment for confounding factors. Compared with individuals carrying none of the biomarkers, the ORs [95% CIs] for stroke of those with 1 and 2 elevated biomarkers were 4.068 [1.670-9.913] and 15.345 [6.198-37.994] after adjustment for confounding factors. The participants with a larger number of biomarkers had an increased risk of stroke (p for trend <0.001). For the combination biomarkers, the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic was 0.716., CONCLUSION: A significant linear relationship between the number of elevated biomarkers and the risk of stroke has been observed, suggesting that elevations of these biomarkers could be used for potentially predicting the disease.

Previous studies have reported that PCG signals contain heart murmurs caused by coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the murmurs caused by CAD are very weak and rarely heard by the human ear.

A total of 110 features were extracted from multiple domains, and then reduced and selected. Images obtained by Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients were used as the input for the convolutional neural network for feature learning. Then, the selected features and the deep learning features were fused and fed into a multilayer perceptron for classification. The proposed feature fusion method achieved better classification performance than multi-domain features or deep learning features alone, with accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 90.43%, 93.67%, and 83.36%, respectively.

One-year cumulative event rates of combined vascular events (a composite of MI, stroke recurrence or vascular death) and cardiac events (a composite of MI, heart failure or cardiac death) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The predictive value of the Essen score was assessed with C-statistics. In multivariate Cox regression analyses, we assessed whether Essen score, etiological subtype and imaging parameters were associated with outcomes. Result(s): Of 13,012 patients were included, the cumulative one-year event rates were 10.03% for combined vascular events and 0.77% for cardiac events, respectively. Compared with those with an Essen score < 3, patients with an Essen score < 3 were more likely to have a subsequent combined vascular event [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.24.1.55] and cardiac events (HR = 2.30, 95% CI: 1.53.3.44). The score tended to be more predictive of the risk of MI (C-statistic = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.55.0.71) and cardiac events (C-statistic = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.56.0.67) than stroke recurrence (C-statistic = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.54.0.57) and combined vascular events (C-statistic = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.54.0.57). In multivariable analysis after adjusted Essen score, patients with multiple acute infarctions or single acute infarctions and large artery atherosclerosis subtype were independently associated with an increased risk of combined vascular events. While the cardioembolism subtype was associated with an increased risk of cardiac events. Conclusion(s): The Essen score is potentially more suitable for risk stratification of cardiovascular events than cerebrovascular events. Moreover, future predictive tools should take brain imaging findings and cause of stroke into consideration.Copyright © 2022 JGC All rights reserved.","Authors":"Li, L.; Jin, Z. N.; Pan, Y.

We aimed to evaluate the relationship between serum Neu5Ac and the risk and prognosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in a real-world prospective study., METHODS: Patients with suspected ACS who underwent coronary angiography were included. Serum Neu5Ac was measured at admission. Coronary lesion severity was evaluated by Gensini Score. GRACE risk stratification was performed at admission.

A positive association of serum GZMK levels with CRP or AAA diameter was confirmed, while there was a relationship between tissue GZMK expression and AAA diameter. The AUC of serum GZMK for AAA diagnosis was 0.78 with the sensitivity and specificity of 62.5% and 81.2%, whereas AUC for rupture detection was 0.76 with a sensitivity of 90.0% and specificity of 51.3%.

Multiple logistic analyses revealed an association of per unit increase of serum GZMK with AAA presence (OR = 1.046, P < 0.001) and its rupture risk (OR = 1.015, P = 0.048) after adjusting for confounding factors. Conclusion(s): Our study provides proof that elevated GZMK expression both in serum and tissues is correlated with the presence of AAA, and serum GZMK may be a useful non-invasive marker that helps to identify AAA and its rupture risk in clinical practice.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Authors":"Li, T.; Yang, C.; Jing, J.; Sun, L.; Yuan, Y.","Publisher":"International Journal of Cardiology","Issue":"Not Available","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2021.06.014","Pages":"242-247","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"granzyme K (GZMK)"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":2053,"Title":"Regional pattern and signatures of gut microbiota in rural residents with coronary heart disease: A metagenomic analysis","Year":2022,"Country":"","Abstract":"Coronary heart disease (CHD) is tightly associated with gut microbiota, but microbiota heterogeneity limits the application of microbial biomarkers and personalized interventions demand regional-specific features. The purpose of this study was to comprehensively characterize the regional pattern of gut microbiota in rural residents with CHD and assess the predictive value and clinical correlations of local microbial signatures. We profiled the gut microbiota by shotgun metagenomic sequencing from 19 CHD and 19 healthy residents in rural Xinxiang, China, and tested the physiological parameters. The results indicated that microbial diversity, as well as KEGG orthology (KO) and carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) functions, deserved no significant disparities between CHD and healthy residents. The relative abundance of Bacteroidetes phylum was significantly lower and unclassified Lachnospiraceae genus, and Eubacterium rectale species were markedly higher in CHD residents compared with the healthy control. Co-occurrence network revealed a more diverse and scattered ecology in CHD residents. LEfSe identified 39 potential biomarkers and butanoate metabolism and glycosyltransferases families were the enhanced KO and CAZymes in CHD residents, respectively. Twenty key signatures were determined by the random forest algorithm and most of them belonged to the Clostridium cluster. These key signatures harbored a superior accuracy of 83.9% to distinguish CHD and healthy residents and, fasting serum insulin, diastolic blood pressure, and body mass index were the top three clinical parameters influencing the gut bacterial community. Furthermore, we also found that low-density lipoprotein and waist circumference had significantly positive correlations with the members of the Clostridium cluster. These findings expand our knowledge in the regional-specific pattern of gut microbiota for rural CHD residents and highlight the non-invasive diagnostic value and clinical correlations of microbial signatures.

In this study, we tried to identify circulating levels of NETs in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and to confirm its suitability as a new circulating marker in their detection. Method(s): We prospectively enrolled 95 patients with a diagnosis of ACS (N = 37) or AIS (N = 58) in Dong-A University Hospital, Busan, Korea. The control group was selected from healthy adults (N = 25) who visited the hospital for health screening. Circulating levels of NETs were evaluated by measuring plasma concentrations of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and DNA-histone complex. Result(s): The concentrations of dsDNA were statistically higher in patients with ACS or AIS than those in the control group (both P <.001). In the univariable and multivariable analyses, statistically significant risk factors were troponin I (TnI) level and dsDNA concentration in the ACS group (P =.046 and P =.015, respectively) and only dsDNA concentration in the AIS group (P =.002). In the receiver operating characteristic curve analyses, the area under the curve values for TnI level and dsDNA concentration in the ACS group were 0.878 and 0.968, respectively, and the value for dsDNA concentration in the AIS group was 0.859. Conclusion(s): In this study, it was confirmed that the circulating level of NETs was increased in patients with ACS and AIS at initial presentation.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate conventional risk factors, as well as plasma and erythrocyte aminothiol concentration in high-risk Azorean patients undergoing elective coronary angiography and to investigate whether any aminothiol was associated with CAD risk and severity., METHODS AND RESULTS: 174 subjects with symptomatic CAD (age 56+/-9y; 68% men) submitted to coronary angiography were split into 2 groups: one formed by CAD patients (>=50% stenosis in at least one major coronary vessel) and the other by non-CAD patients (<50% stenosis). Both groups were age-, sex- and BMI-matched. Plasma and erythrocyte aminothiol profiles were evaluated by RP-HPLC/FLD. CAD patients significantly exhibited both higher concentrations of plasma Cys and hypercysteinemia (Cys >= 300 muM) prevalence than those in the non-CAD group (261 +/- 58 muM vs. 243 +/- 56 muM; 22% vs. 10%, respectively). No differences were observed between groups regarding plasma Hcy levels or hyperhomocysteinemia prevalence. After adjustment for several confounders (including Hcy), subjects in the highest quartile of plasma Cys had a 3.31 (95% CI, 1.32-8.30, p = 0.011) fold risk for CAD, compared with those in the lowest quartiles. Furthermore, plasma Cys levels (but not Hcy) tended to increase with the number of stenotic vessels (1VD: 253 +/- 64 muM; 2VD: 262 +/- 52 muM; 3VD: 279 +/- 57 muM, p = 0.129)., CONCLUSION: Hypercysteinemia revealed to be a better predictor of CAD than hyperhomocysteinemia. Moreover, plasma Cys showed to be a useful biomarker for CAD both in primary and secondary preventions, seeming to resist better than Hcy to oral medication therapy.

However, the relationship between CYP2C19 polymorphisms and the response to clopidogrel in patients treated for ischemic stroke (IS) remains controversial. What's more, few data address the relevance of CYP2C19 polymorphisms in patients taking clopidogrel for secondary prevention of ischemic stroke. This study investigates whether carrying CYP2C19 loss-of-function (LOF) alleles affects the risk of recurrent stroke in IS patients., METHODS: One hundred twenty-two IS patients were CYP2C19 genotype screened and enrolled in the study from January 2016 to December 2017. Those with stroke recurrence, stroke sequelae, or bleeding diseases were excluded. The remaining 89 patients were divided into the following 2 groups: non-carriers of CYP2C19 LOF alleles (n=38) and carriers (n=51) of CYP2C19 LOF alleles. The variables that could influence the rate of recurrent stroke were assessed in a multivariate analysis to determine the independent risk factors., RESULTS: The CYP2C19*2 and *3 alleles frequencies among the 122 patients were 31.97% and 4.10%, respectively. Carriers of LOF alleles had a more significant history of hypertension compared with non-carriers [n=43/51 (86.7%) versus n=23/38 (60.5%), P=0.01].

CYP2C19 LOF alleles were significantly associated with an increased risk of recurrent stroke [odds ratio (OR): 7.586; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.346-42.770, P=0.022]., CONCLUSIONS: CYP2C19 LOF alleles may increase the risk of recurrent IS. The polymorphisms of CYP2C19 may be predictors of a poor functional outcome in patients with recurrent stroke. Instead of clopidogrel, aspirin can be prescribed as a secondary preventative measure against stroke in carriers of CYP2C19 LOF alleles.","Authors":"Lin, Juanna; Mo, You; Cai, De; Mao, Dongyang; Fu, Hongbo; Wei, Duncan","Publisher":"Annals of palliative medicine","Issue":"12","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.21037/apm-21-2905","Pages":"12171-12180","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) polymorphisms"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":3,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":18,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":24,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":2131,"Title":"Reduced Cerebral Blood Flow in Benign Oligemia Relates to Poor Clinical Outcome in Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients","Year":2021,"Country":"","Abstract":"The imaging of cerebral blow flow (CBF) has shown great promise in predicting the tissue outcome or functional outcome of acute ischemic stroke patients. Arterial spin labeling (ASL) provides a noninvasive tool for quantitative CBF measurement and does not require a contrast agent, which makes it an attractive technology for perfusion imaging in clinical settings. Previous studies have shown the feasibility of using ASL for acute stroke imaging and its potential in stroke outcome prediction. However, the relationship between the tissue-level CBF reduction in hypoperfused region and clinical outcome in acute stroke patients remains not well understood. In this study, we obtained the quantitative measurements of CBF in acute ischemic stroke patients (N = 18) using pseudocontinuous ASL (pCASL) perfusion imaging technology. The tissue-level CBF changes were evaluated and their correlations with patient clinical outcome were explored. Our results showed different CBF values between hypoperfused tissues recruited into infarction and those that survived. Moreover, a significant correlation was found specifically between the CBF reduction in benign oligemia area and patient neurological deficit severity. These findings showed the validity of pCASL perfusion imaging in the assessment of tissue-level CBF information in acute stroke. The association of CBF with patient clinical outcome might provide useful insights in early diagnosis of acute stroke patients.","Authors":"Lin, Zengping; Wang, Tianyao; Li, Yao","Publisher":"Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

DNA methylation has essential roles in multiple diseases, but its association with stroke was barely studied. We hereby explored the association between blood-based HTRA serine protease 1 (HTRA1) methylation and the risk of stroke. Result(s): The association was discovered in a hospital-based case-control study (cases/controls = 190:190) and further validated in a prospective nested case-control study including 139 cases who developed stroke within 2 years after recruitment and 144 matched stroke-free controls. We observed stroke-related altered HTRA1 methylation and expression in both case-control study and prospective study. This blood-based HTRA1 methylation was associated with stroke independently from the known risk factors and mostly affected the older population. The prospective results further showed that the altered HTRA1 methylation was detectable 2 years before the clinical determination of stroke and became more robust with increased discriminatory power for stroke along with time when combined with other known stroke-related variables [onset time <= 1 year: area under the curve (AUC) = 0.76]. Conclusion(s): In our study, altered HTRA1 methylation was associated with stroke at clinical and preclinical stages and thus may provide a potential biomarker in the blood for the risk evaluation and preclinical detection of stroke.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s).","Authors":"Liu, C.; Li, M.; Yin, Q.; Fan, Y.; Shen, C.; Yang, R.","Publisher":"Clinical Epigenetics","Issue":"1","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13148-022-01418-0","Pages":"191","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"HTRA serine protease 1 (HTRA1) methylation"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":3,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":18,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":24,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":25,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":31,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":37,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":2170,"Title":"Machine learning prediction of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage after stroke thrombolysis: a cross-cultural validation in Caucasian and Han Chinese cohort","Year":2022,"Country":"","Abstract":"Background: Previous studies found that Asians seemed to have higher risk of HT after thrombolysis than Caucasians due to its race differences in genetic polymorphism. Whether the model developed by Caucasians could predict risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) in Asians was unknown. Objective(s): To develop a machine learning-based model for predicting sICH after stroke thrombolysis in Caucasians and externally validate it in an independent Han Chinese cohort. Design(s): The derivation Caucasian sample included 1738 ischemic stroke (IS) patients from the Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive (VISTA) data set, and the external validation Han Chinese cohort included 296 IS patients who were treated with intravenous thrombolysis. Method(s): Twenty-eight variables were collected across both samples. According to their properties, we classified them into six distinct clusters (ie, demographic variables, medical history, previous medication, baseline blood biomarkers, neuroimaging markers on initial CT scan and clinical characteristics). A support vector machine (SVM) model, which consisted of data processing, model training, testing and a 10-fold cross-validation, was developed to predict the risk of sICH after stroke thrombolysis. The receiving operating characteristic (ROC) was used to assess the prediction performance of the SVM model. A domain contribution analysis was then performed to test which cluster had the highest influence on the performance of the model. Result(s): In total, 85 (4.9%) patients developed sICH in the Caucasians, and 29 (9.8%) patients developed sICH in the Han Chinese cohort. Eight features including age, NIHSS score, SBP (systolic blood pressure), DBP (diastolic blood pressure), ALP (alkaline phosphatase), ALT (alanine transaminase), glucose, and creatine level were included in the final model, all of which were from demographic, clinical characteristics, and blood biomarkers clusters, respectively. The SVM model showed a good predictive performance in both Caucasians (AUC = 0.87) and Han Chinese patients (AUC = 0.74). Domain contribution analysis showed that inclusion/exclusion of clinical characteristic cluster (NIHSS score, SBP, and DBP), had the highest influence on the performance of predicting sICH in both Caucasian and Han Chinese cohorts.

Out of these metabolites, 25 lipid metabolites were identified which showed specifical expression in the AMI group compared with the healthy control (HC) group and unstable angina (UA) group. Then, we applied the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) methods to obtain three lipid molecules, including CarnitineC18:1-OH, CarnitineC18:2-OH and FFA (20:1). The three lipid metabolites and the diagnostic model exhibited well predictive ability in discriminating between AMI patients and UA patients in both the discovery and validation sets with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses indicated that the three lipid metabolites may serve as potential biomarkers for diagnosing AMI. A subsequent 1-year follow-up analysis indicated that the three lipid biomarkers also had prominent performance in predicting re-admission of patients with AMI due to cardiovascular events. In summary, we used quantitative lipid technology to delineate the characteristics of lipid metabolism in patients with AMI, and identified potential early diagnosis biomarkers of AMI via machine learning approach.Copyright © 2022 Liu, Tang, Lu, Yu, Xu, Zhang, Chen, Dai and Li.","Authors":"Liu, J.; Tang, L.; Lu, Q.; Yu, Y.; Xu, Q.

Conventional diagnostic methods are dependent on advanced instruments, which are expensive, inaccessible, and inconvenient in underdeveloped areas. To build a novel dried blood spot (DBS) detection strategy for imaging CVDs, in this study, a total of 12 compounds, including seven amino acids [homocysteine (Hcy), isoleucine (Ile), leucine (Leu), valine (Val), phenylalanine (Phe), tyrosine (Tyr), and tryptophan (Trp)], three amino acid derivatives [choline, betaine, and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO)], L-carnitine, and creatinine, were screened for their ability to identify CVD. A rapid and reliable method was established for the quantitative analysis of the 12 compounds in DBS. A total of 526 CVD patients and 200 healthy volunteers in five provinces of China were recruited and divided into the following groups: stroke, coronary heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure. The orthogonal projection to latent structures-discriminant analysis (OPLSDA) model was used to characterize the difference between each CVD group. Marked differences between the groups based on the OPLSDA model were observed. Based on the model, the patients in the three training sets were mostly accurately categorized into the appropriate group. In addition, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and logistic regression of each metabolite chosen by the OPLSDA model had an excellent predictive value in both the test and validation groups. DBS detection of 12 biomarkers was sensitive and powerful for characterizing different types of CVD. Such differentiation may reduce unnecessary invasive coronary angiography, enhance predictive value, and complement current diagnostic methods.© Copyright © 2020 Liu, Jin, Wu, Yang, Xu, Li, Ren and Yan.","Authors":"Liu, L.; Jin, X.; Wu, Y.; Yang, M.; Xu, T.; Li, X.; Ren, J.; Yan, L.

It is important to find early simple screening biomarkers and find residual risk factors that may provide a new target for prevention and treatment of PAD in diabetic patients besides traditional cardiometabolic risk factors., Methods: We performed a cross-sectional retrospective study, and a total of 1671 T2DM participants were recruited.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of cardiovascular magnetic resonance feature tracking (CMR-FT) and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) to distinguish between HCM and HHD and the potential relationship between myocardial strain and cardiac functional parameters. Method(s): One hundred and seventy subjects (57 HCM, 45 HHD, and 68 controls) underwent 3.0 T CMR, including steady-state free precession cines and LGE images. Global and segmental (basal, mid, and apical) analyses of myocardial radial, circumferential, longitudinal strain, and left ventricular (LV) torsion, as well as global and 16 segments of LGE were assessed. The multivariate analysis was used to predict the diagnostic ability by combining comprehensive myocardial strain parameters and LGE. Result(s): Global radial strain (GRS), global circumferential strain (GCS), and LV torsion were significantly higher in the HCM group than in the HHD group (GRS, 21.18 +/- 7.52 vs. 14.56 +/- 7.46%; GCS, -13.34 +/- 3.52 vs. -10.11 +/- 4.13%; torsion, 1.79 +/- 0.69 vs. 1.23 +/- 0.65 deg/cm, all P < 0.001). A similar trend was also seen in the corresponding strain rate. As for segmental strain analysis, basal radial strain (BRS), basal circumferential strain (BCS), basal longitudinal strain (BLS), mid-radial strain (MRS), and mid-circumferential strain (MCS) were higher in the HCM group than in the HHD group (all P < 0.001). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) results showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of LGE in the mid-interventricular septum (mIVS) was the highest among global and segmental LGE analyses. On the multivariate regression analysis, a combined model of LGE (mIVS) with GRS obtained the highest AUC value, which was 0.835 with 88.89% sensitivity and 70.18% specificity, respectively. In addition, for patients with HCM, GRS, GCS, and global longitudinal strain had correlations with LV ejection fraction (LVEF), maximum interventricular septum thickness (IVST max), and left ventricular mass index (LVMi). Torsion was mildly associated with LVEF. Conclusion(s): CMR-FT-derived myocardial strain and torsion provided valuable methods for evaluation of HCM and HHD. In addition, the combination of GRS and LGE (mIVS) achieved the highest diagnostic value.Copyright © 2022 Liu, Li, Zhao, Wang, Wu, Gu, Xu, Li, Tian, Cui, Wang and Yu.","Authors":"Liu, S.; Zhao, Y.; Wang, X.; Wu, Z.; Gu, X.; Xu, B.; Li, Y.; Tian, J.; Cui, J.; Wang, G.; Yu, B.","Publisher":"Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine","Issue":"Not Available","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fcvm.2022.865615","Pages":"865615","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"cardiovascular magnetic resonance feature tracking (CMR-FT) & late gadolinium enhancement (LGE)"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":10,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":3,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":18,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":2198,"Title":"Fibrinogen is associated with glucose metabolism and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease","Year":2020,"Country":"","Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The present cohort study aims to examine the relationship between fibrinogen (Fib) levels and glucose metabolism [fasting blood glucose (FBG) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)] and investigate the impact of high Fib on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with stable CAD and pre-diabetes mellitus (pre-DM) or diabetes mellitus (DM)., METHODS: This study included 5237 patients from March 2011 to December 2015. Patients were distributed into three groups according to Fib levels (low Fib, median Fib, high Fib) and further categorized by glucose metabolism status [normal glucose regulation (NGR), Pre-DM, DM]. All patients were followed up for the occurrences of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), including cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal MI, stroke, and unplanned coronary revascularization., RESULTS: Linear regression analyses showed that FBG and HbA1c levels were positively associated with Fib in overall CAD participants, either with or without DM (all P < 0.001). During an average of 18,820 patient-years of follow-up, 476 MACEs occurred. High Fib was independently associated with MACEs after adjusting for confounding factors [Hazard Ratio (HR): 1.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26-1.97, P < 0.001]. Furthermore, DM but not pre-DM was a significant predictor of MACEs (P < 0.001 and P > 0.05, respectively). When patients were stratified by both glucose metabolism status and Fib levels, high Fib was associated with a higher risk of MACEs in pre-DM (HR 1.66, 95% CI 1.02-2.71, P < 0.05). Medium and high Fib levels were associated with an even higher risk of MACEs in DM (HR 1.86, 95% CI 1.14-3.05 and HR 2.28, 95% CI 1.42-3.66, all P < 0.05). After adding the combination of Fib and glucose status to the Cox model, the C-statistic was increased by 0.015 (0.001-0.026)., CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggested that Fib levels were associated with FBG and HbA1c in stable CAD patients. Moreover, elevated Fib was independently associated with MACEs in CAD patients, especially among those with pre-DM and DM, suggesting that Fib may provide incremental value in the cardiovascular risk stratification of pre-DM and DM patients.","Authors":"Liu, Shuo-Lin; Wu, Na-Qiong; Shi, Hui-Wei; Dong, Qian; Dong, Qiu-Ting; Gao, Ying; Guo, Yuan-Lin; Li, Jian-Jun","Publisher":"Cardiovascular diabetology","Issue":"1","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12933-020-01012-9","Pages":"36","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"fibrinogen (Fib)"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":3,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":18,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":2203,"Title":"Influence of miRNA Gene Polymorphism on Recurrence and Age at Onset of Ischemic Stroke in a Chinese Han Population","Year":2020,"Country":"","Abstract":"Polymorphisms in microRNAs (miRNAs) are associated with ischemic stroke occurrence and traditional risk factors for ischemic stroke such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. However, few studies have examined recurrent ischemic stroke as an outcome. Thus, the aim of our study was to examine association of miRNA gene polymorphisms (namely, miR-126 rs4636297, miR-149 rs2292832, miR-124 rs531564, miR-499 rs3746444, miR-143 rs12655723, and miR-122 rs17669) with recurrence of ischemic stroke. miRNA gene polymorphisms were genotyped using the polymerase chain reaction-ligation detection reaction (PCR-LDR) method in 657 patients with ischemic stroke. Association of miRNA polymorphisms with prognosis outcomes was examined by the Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazards models. miR-122 rs17669 was significantly associated with recurrence risk of ischemic stroke under the recessive model. Cox regression analysis showed that the CC genotype of rs17669 was associated with an increased risk of 1.9-fold for stroke recurrence (hazard ratio = 1.879; 95% confidence interval = 1.182-2.985; P = 0.008). Further, this effect was more evident among the non-drinker and male subgroups. We found no difference in risk of recurrent ischemic stroke among the other five miRNA polymorphisms. Furthermore, we identified a significant association between the miR-149 rs2292832 polymorphism and age at onset of first-ever stroke. Altogether, miR-122 rs17669 is a significant predictor for the risk of recurrent stroke, independent of traditional risk factors.Copyright © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Authors":"Liu, X.; Wang, Q.; Zhu, R.","Publisher":"Neurotoxicity Research","Issue":"4","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12640-019-00125-8","Pages":"781-787","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"miR-122 variant rs17669"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":3,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":37,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":2210,"Title":"Dysregulation Serum miR-19a-3p is a Diagnostic Biomarker for Asymptomatic Carotid Artery Stenosis and a Promising Predictor of Cerebral Ischemia Events","Year":2021,"Country":"","Abstract":"This study aims to identify the diagnostic potential of microRNA-19a-3p (miR-19a-3p) for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis (CAS) and clinical predictive potential for cerebral ischemia events (CIEs).

The general data of the subjects in the two groups were collected. The serum miR-106 level of the subjects in the two groups was detected by fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the level of MYL4 was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The expression of miR-106 and MYL4 in the myocardium was observed by immunohistochemistry. The relationship between the levels of serum miR-106 and MYL4 and the prevalence of atrial fibrillation and the score of atrial fibrillation thromboembolism risk stratification scoring system (cha2ds2) was compared between the two groups. The relationship between serum level of miR-106 and prognosis of patients with atrial fibrillation was analyzed., Results: The systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and left anterior descending artery (LAD) in the atrial fibrillation group were significantly higher than those in the control group, while HDL-C and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were significantly lower than those in the control group (P < 0.01). The level of serum miR-106 in patients with atrial fibrillation was significantly higher than that in the control group, whereas the level of MYL4 was significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.01). miR-106 was mainly localized in the cytoplasm, and the positive expression rate of miR-106 was 71.43% (81/115) in patients with atrial fibrillation and 21.74% (25/115) in patients with sinus rhythm. MYL4 was mainly located in the cell membrane and the positive expression rate of MYL4 was 24.35% (28/115) in patients with atrial fibrillation and 64.35% (74/115) in patients with sinus rhythm. With the increase of the severity of atrial fibrillation, the level of serum miR-106 gradually increased and the level of MYL4 gradually decreased, which were statistically significant compared with the control group (P < 0.05). With the increase of miR-106 level and the decrease of MYL4 level, the prevalence of atrial fibrillation gradually increased. With the increase of cha2ds2 score, the level of serum miR-106 increased and the level of MYL4 decreased. The survival rate of patients with miR - 106 <= 1.96 was significantly higher than that of patients with miR - 106 > 1.96. The survival rate of patients with MYL4 >= 0.24 was significantly higher than that of patients with MYL4 < 0.24. At the same time, TC and LDL-C were included in the analysis. The results showed that the survival rate of patients with TC <= 4.5 mmol/L was significantly higher than that of patients with TC > 4.5 mmol/L, and that of patients with LDL-C <= 2.6 mmol/L was significantly higher than that of patients with LDL-C > 2.6 mmol/L., Conclusion: Serum miR-106 and MYL4 levels are closely related to the prevalence of atrial fibrillation, which can reflect the risk of thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation and can be used as a biological indicator to predict the prognosis of patients with atrial fibrillation.

NT-proBNP and recently, corin, also a key enzyme in the cleavage of pro-BNP, have been accepted as predictors of prognosis after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). This cohort study was conducted to investigate the relationship between plasma furin and the prognostic outcomes of AMI patients. Method(s): In total, 1100 AMI patients were enrolled in the study and their plasma furin concentrations were measured. The primary endpoint was major adverse cardiac events (MACE), a composite of cardiovascular (CV) death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) and non-fatal stroke. The associations between plasma furin concentration and AMI outcomes were explored using Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariate Cox regression analysis. Result(s): The results showed a slight increase in mean cTNT in patients with higher furin concentrations (P = 0.016). Over a median follow-up of 31 months, multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that plasma furin was not significantly associated with MACE (HR 1.01; 95% CI 0.93-1.06; P = 0.807) after adjustment for potential conventional risk factors. However, plasma furin was associated with non-fatal MI (HR 1.09; 95% CI 1.01-1.17; P = 0.022) in the fully adjusted model. Subgroup analyses indicated no relationship between plasma furin and MACE in different subgroups. Conclusion(s): This study found no association between plasma furin and risk of MACE. Thus, plasma furin may not be a useful predictor of poor prognosis after AMI. However, higher levels of plasma furin may be associated with a higher risk of recurrent non-fatal MI.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).","Authors":"Liu, Z. W.; Ma, Q.; Liu, J.; Li, J. W.; Chen, Y.

We aim to test the ability of biomarkers of fibrosis (galectin-3 (Gal-3)) and adiposity (fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) and leptin) to predict: (1) the presence of low-voltage areas (LVA) in the electroanatomic voltage mapping; and (2) the recurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) after pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). Method(s): Patients referred for PVI were enrolled. Areas of bipolar voltage < 0.5 mV were considered as LVA. An aggregate score incorporating AF pattern (paroxysmal, persistent and long-standing persistent) and peripheral levels of FABP4 (>20 ng/mL) was developed. Result(s): 299 patients were included. AF was paroxysmal in 100 (33%), persistent in 130 (43%) and long-standing persistent in 69 (23%). Multivariable analysis revealed age, left atrium area, and the proposed score as independent predictors of LVA. During a mean follow-up period of 972 +/- 451 days, freedom from AF recurrence was 63%. The score incorporating AF pattern and FABP4 levels accurately predicted freedom from AF recurrence, stratifying risk into ranges from 28% (score of 1) to 68% (score of 3). Cox regression models identified the score including AF pattern + FABP4 as the best model for AF recurrence (hazard ratio 2.32; 95% CI, 1.19 to 4.5; p = 0.014). Conclusion(s): Traditional clinical classification of atrial cardiomyopathy may be improved by markers of adiposity (FABP4).

We evaluated the utility of clinical, imaging parameters along with electrographic and echocardiographic biomarkers of atrial dysfunction in 2 etiological groups, namely LAA and cryptogenic strokes and compared the predictors of recurrence risk at 1 year. Methodology: All acute ischemic strokes admitted to Comprehensive Stroke Care Centre, Department of Neurology, Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology, Trivandrum, India for 1 year (July 2019 till June 2020) with 1 year completed follow-up were screened from electronic records. Strokes secondary to LAA and undetermined cause were compared for their clinical, imaging, and cardiac variables to predict risk of recurrence in the first year. Result(s): Of the 179 patients, 93 had strokes secondary to LAA and 86 had cryptogenic strokes (CS). Seventy-five patients had more than 1 event at presentation/follow-up. Recurrence risk did not differ between the 2 etiological subgroups at 1 year. Hypertension (P =.016), multiple territory strokes (P =.02), and dilated left ventricle (LA) chamber (P =.047) were independently associated with recurrence risk in the entire cohort as well as within the undetermined group. Early hospitalization within 48 h reduced the overall recurrence risk (P =.01), thus emphasizing the role of early etiological evaluation and initiation of secondary prevention in reducing future events, irrespective of etiology. Conclusion(s): In optimally managed LAA and cryptogenic strokes, presence of hypertension, multiterritorial infarcts, and dilated LA chambers increases the recurrence risk pointing to a likely cardiac substrate itself contributing to future stroke risk.Copyright © 2022 Indian Stroke Association.","Authors":"Lotlikar, R.

Anticoagulation treatment using warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants is effective in reducing the risk of AF-related stroke by approximately two-thirds and can provide a 10% reduction in overall mortality. There has been increased interest in detecting AF due to its increased incidence and the possibility to prevent AF-related strokes. Inexpensive consumer devices which measure the ECG may have the potential to accurately detect AF but do not generally incorporate diagnostic algorithms. Machine learning algorithms have the potential to improve patient outcomes particularly where diagnoses are made from large volumes or complex patterns of data such as in AF. Methods We designed a novel AF detection algorithm using a de-correlated Lorenz plot of 60 consecutive RR intervals. In order to reduce the volume of data, the resulting images were compressed using a wavelet transformation (JPEG200 algorithm) and the compressed images were used as input data to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. We used the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)-Beth Israel Hospital (BIH) Atrial Fibrillation database and the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database as training data and verified the algorithm performance using RR intervals collected using an inexpensive consumer heart rate monitor device (Polar-H7) in a case-control study. Results The SVM algorithm yielded excellent discrimination in the training data with a sensitivity of 99.2% and a specificity of 99.5% for AF. In the validation data, the SVM algorithm correctly identified AF in 79/79 cases; sensitivity 100% (95% CI 95.4%-100%) and non-AF in 328/336 cases; specificity 97.6% (95% CI 95.4%-99.0%). Conclusions An inexpensive wearable heart rate monitor and machine learning algorithm can be used to detect AF with very high accuracy and has the capability to transmit ECG data which could be used to confirm AF. It could potentially be used for intermittent screening or continuously for prolonged periods to detect paroxysmal AF. Further work could lead to cost-effective and accurate estimation of AF burden and improved risk stratification in AF.Copyright © 2020 Lown et al.

In this study, we used T2DM clinical variables to predict abnormality in thallium-201 myocardial perfusion scans (Th-201 scans). These clinical variables were summed stress score (SSS), summed rest score, and summed difference score (SDS), with data obtained from 368 male and 428 female participants with T2DM. Multiple linear regression results were as follows. In male participants, body mass index (BMI) and creatinine (Cr) were associated with SSS (beta = 0.224, p < 0.001; beta = 0.140, p = 0.022, respectively), and only BMI was associated with SDS (beta = 0.174, p = 0.004).

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) provide an opportunity to understand risk factors since they reflect etiologic pathways from the entire genome. We therefore tested whether a PRS for CHD influenced risk of CHD in individuals with type 2 diabetes and which risk factors were associated with this PRS., METHODS: We tested the association of a CHD PRS with CHD and its traditional clinical risk factors amongst individuals with type 2 diabetes in UK Biobank (N = 21,102). We next tested the association of the CHD PRS with atherosclerotic burden in a cohort of 352 genome-wide genotyped participants with type 2 diabetes who had undergone coronary angiograms., RESULTS: In the UK Biobank we found that the CHD PRS was strongly associated with CHD amongst individuals with type 2 diabetes (OR per standard deviation increase = 1.50; p = 1.5 x 10- 59). But this CHD PRS was, at best, only weakly associated with traditional clinical risk factors, such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, glycemic control, obesity and smoking. Conversely, in the angiographic cohort, the CHD PRS was strongly associated with multivessel stenosis (OR = 1.65; p = 4.9 x 10- 4) and increased number of major stenotic lesions (OR = 1.35; p = 9.4 x 10- 3)., CONCLUSIONS: Polygenic predisposition to CHD is strongly associated with atherosclerotic burden in individuals with type 2 diabetes and this effect is largely independent of traditional clinical risk factors. This suggests that genetic risk for CHD acts through atherosclerosis with little effect on most traditional risk factors, providing the opportunity to explore new biological pathways.","Authors":"Lu, Tianyuan; Forgetta, Vincenzo; Yu, Oriana H.

The objective of this study was to construct a diagnostic model for the rapid identification of ischemic stroke. Method(s): A mixture population constituted of patients with ischemic stroke (n = 481), patients with hemorrhagic stroke (n = 116), and healthy individuals from communities (n = 2498) were randomly resampled into training (n = 1547, mean age: 55 years, 44% males) and testing (n = 1548, mean age: 54 years, 43% males) samples. Serum corin was assayed using commercial ELISA kits. Potential risk factors including age, sex, education level, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, obesity, blood pressure, lipids, glucose, and medical history were obtained as candidate predictors. The diagnostic model of ischemic stroke was developed using a backward stepwise logistic regression model in the training sample and validated in the testing sample. Result(s): The final diagnostic model included age, sex, cigarette smoking, family history of stroke, history of hypertension, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting glucose, and serum corin. The diagnostic model exhibited good discrimination in both training (AUC: 0.910, 95% CI: 0.884-0.936) and testing (AUC: 0.907, 95% CI: 0.881-0.934) samples. Calibration curves showed good concordance between the observed and predicted probability of ischemic stroke in both samples (all P>0.05). Conclusion(s): We developed a simple diagnostic model with routinely available variables to assist rapid identification of ischemic stroke. The effectiveness and efficiency of this model warranted further investigation.Copyright © 2022 Lu et al.","Authors":"Lu, Y.; Wang, W.; Tang, Z.; Chen, L.; Zhang, M.; Zhang, Q.; Wu, L.; Jiang, J.; Zhang, X.; He, C.; Peng, H.","Publisher":"Journal of Multidisciplinary Healthcare","Issue":"Not Available","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.2147/JMDH.S395896","Pages":"2933-2943","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"model with clinical & demographic variables"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":10,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":18,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":2274,"Title":"Serum creatinine to cystatin C ratio is associated with major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with obstructive coronary artery disease","Year":2021,"Country":"","Abstract":"Background & aims: Sarcopenia is a clinical syndrome that features muscle atrophy and weakness, and has been associated with cardiovascular events and poor clinical outcomes. Recently, the sarcopenia index (SI) was developed as a simple screening tool based upon the serum creatinine to cystatin C (CysC) ratio. We investigated the association between SI and the prevalence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with obstructive CAD. Methods & Results: Between January 2010 and December 2018, patients with angina pectoris and obstructive CAD requiring coronary artery intervention were enrolled. Serum levels of CysC and other biomarkers were assessed. Patients were divided into two groups according to the SI ([Cr/CysC] x 100). Demographic characteristics and clinical outcomes of the two groups were evaluated. A total of 427 patients (79.6% men, mean age 69.55 +/- 12.04 years) were enrolled. Patients with SI < 120 (n = 214, 28%) were older, more likely to be of the female gender, and to have more hypertension and congestive heart failure (all p < 0.05). The prevalence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) composed of myocardial infarction, stroke, and all-cause mortality was higher in patients with lower SI (p = 0.026). After adjusting for potential confounding factors, multivariate Cox regression (hazard ratio 2.08, p = 0.045) and Kaplan-Meier analyses (log-rank p = 0.0371) revealed that lower SI was significantly associated with a higher prevalence of MACE. Conclusion(s): Serum creatinine to cystatin C ratio (SI) may be a useful surrogate marker to predict the future prevalence of MACE in patients with obstructive CAD.Copyright © 2021 The Italian Diabetes Society, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University","Authors":"Lu, Y.

We aimed to identify and describe technology with existing proof of concept for diagnosis or stratification of patients in the pre-hospital setting., METHODS: A systematic electronic search of published literature (from 01/01/2000 to 06/06/2019) was conducted in five bibliographic databases. Two reviewers independently assessed eligibility of studies or study protocols describing diagnostic/stratification tests (portable imaging/biomarkers) or technology facilitating diagnosis/stratification (telemedicine) used by ambulance personnel during the assessment of suspected stroke. Eligible descriptions required use of tests or technology during the actual assessment of suspected stroke to provide information directly to ambulance personnel in the pre-hospital setting. Due to study, intervention and setting heterogeneity there was no attempt at meta-analysis., RESULTS: 2887 articles were screened for eligibility, 19 of which were retained. Blood biomarker studies (n = 2) were protocols of prospective diagnostic accuracy studies, one examining purines and the other a panel of known and novel biomarkers for identifying stroke sub-types (versus mimic). No data were yet available on diagnostic accuracy or patient health outcomes. Portable imaging studies (n = 2) reported that an infrared screening device for detecting haemorrhages yielded moderate sensitivity and poor specificity in a small study, whilst a dry-EEG study to detect large vessel occlusion in ischaemic stroke has not yet reported results. Fifteen evaluations of pre-hospital telemedicine were identified (12 observational and 3 controlled comparisons) which all involved transmission of stroke assessment data from the pre-hospital setting to the hospital. Diagnosis was generally comparable with hospital diagnosis and most telemedicine systems reduced time-to-treatment; however, it is unknown whether this time saving translated into more favourable clinical outcomes. Telemedicine systems were deemed acceptable by clinicians., CONCLUSIONS: Pre-hospital technologies to identify clinically important subgroups amongst the suspected stroke population are in development but insufficient evidence precludes recommendations about routine use in the pre-hospital setting. Multi-centre diagnostic accuracy studies and clinical utility trials combining promising technologies are warranted.","Authors":"Lumley, Hannah A.; Flynn, Darren; Shaw, Lisa; McClelland, Graham; Ford, Gary A.; White, Phil M.; Price, Christopher I.","Publisher":"BMC emergency medicine","Issue":"1","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12873-020-00323-0","Pages":"30","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"telestroke system technology & biomarker from 19 studies"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":3,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":24,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":2303,"Title":"Multiparametric and multilevel characterization of morphological alterations in patients with transient ischemic attack","Year":2021,"Country":"","Abstract":"Transient ischemic attack (TIA), an important risk factor for stroke, is associated with widespread disruptions of functional brain architecture. However, TIA-related structural alterations are not well established. By analyzing structural MRI data from 50 TIA patients versus 40 healthy controls (HCs), here we systematically investigated TIA-related morphological alterations in multiple cortical surface-based indices (cortical thickness [CT], fractal dimension [FD], gyrification index [GI], and sulcal depth [SD]) at multiple levels (local topography, interregional connectivity and whole-brain network topology). For the observed alterations, their associations with clinical risk factors and abilities as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers were further examined. We found that compared with the HCs, the TIA patients showed widespread morphological alterations and the alterations depended on choices of morphological index and analytical level. Specifically, the patients exhibited: (a) regional CT decreases in the transverse temporal gyrus and lateral sulcus; (b) impaired FD- and GI-based connectivity mainly involving visual, somatomotor and ventral attention networks and interhemispheric connections; and (c) altered GI-based whole-brain network efficiency and decreased FD-based nodal centrality in the middle frontal gyrus. Moreover, the impaired morphological connectivity showed high sensitivities and specificities for distinguishing the patients from HCs. Altogether, these findings demonstrate the emergence of morphological index-dependent and analytical level-specific alterations in TIA, which provide novel insights into neurobiological mechanisms underlying TIA and may serve as potential biomarkers to help diagnosis of the disease. Meanwhile, our findings highlight the necessity of using multiparametric and multilevel approaches for a complete mapping of cerebral morphology in health and disease.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

It has been challenging to identify patients who had high-risk stroke using a simple, valid and non-invasive screening approach. This study aimed to investigate whether fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) vascular hyperintensity (FVH), a specific imaging sign on the FLAIR sequence, could be a predictor of ischaemic events in a population with internal carotid artery (ICA) or middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. Method(s): We retrospectively analysed 147 patients (mean 60.43+/-12.83 years) with 149 lesions, including 37 asymptomatic and 112 symptomatic cases of ICA or MCA occlusion. Symptomatic occlusion was considered if ischaemic events were present in the relevant territory within 90 days. FVH Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score (FVH-ASPECTS: 0-7, with 0 indicating absence of FVH and 7 suggesting prominent FVH) and collateral circulation grade were assessed for each participant. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to detect independent markers associated with symptomatic status. Result(s): A lower FVH-ASPECTS was associated with a more favourable collateral circulation grade (rho=-0.464, p<0.0001). The FVH-ASPECTS was significantly lower in the asymptomatic occlusion group than in the symptomatic occlusion group (p<0.0001). FVH-ASPECTS (Odd ratio, 2.973; 95% confidence interval, 1.849 to 4.781; p<0.0001) was independently associated with symptomatic status after adjustment for age, sex, lesion location and collateral circulation grade in the multivariate logistic regression. The area under the curve was 0.861 for the use of FVH-ASPECTS to identify symptomatic occlusion. Conclusion(s): The ability to discriminate symptomatic from asymptomatic occlusion suggests that FVH may be a predictor of stroke. As a simple imaging sign, FVH may serve as a surrogate for haemodynamic impairments and can be used to identify high-risk stroke cases early in ICA or MCA occlusion.

Objective(s): This study aims to determine significant clinical and genetic factors of AIS recurrence, and to investigate the combined effect of genotypes on the occurrence of a second cerebral ischemic attack. Method(s): We investigated a cohort study of AIS patients (18-50 years old) followed in the neurology department over 5 years. Traditional and genetic risk factors were carried through a multivariable logistic regression model. We used a Cox proportional hazard model for identifying predictors of recurrence. Result(s): Two hundred and seventy patients were enrolled in our study. The risk of AIS recurrence was 36.2% within 5 years. The potential risk of recurrence of AIS increased with traditional and genetic risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, and family history of cerebrovascular diseases. This risk increased with increasing number of genetic factors. The hazard ratio (HR) was 0.66 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.97-2.67) for the subject with one genetic factor, 1.61 (95% CI 0.97-2.25) for combined methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) polymorphisms, and 2.57 (95% CI 1.32-4.99) for combined factor V Leiden (FVL) and MTHFR polymorphisms (677 or 1298).

The difference of Jaccard coefficient, Dice coefficient, peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), running time, and segmentation accuracy of the optimized FLICM algorithm and other algorithms when the brain tissue MRI images were segmented was studied. 36 patients with lacunar infarction were selected as the research objects, and they were divided into a control group (no restroke, 20 cases) and a stroke group (restroke, 16 cases) according to whether the patients had restroke. The differences in MRI imaging characteristics of the two groups of patients were compared, and the risk factors for restroke in lacunar infarction were analyzed by logistic multivariate regression. The results showed that the Jaccard coefficient, Dice coefficient, PSNR value, and SSIM value of the optimized FLICM algorithm for segmenting brain tissue were all higher than those of other algorithms. The shortest running time was 26 s, and the highest accuracy rate was 97.86%. The proportion of patients with a history of hypertension, the proportion of patients with paraventricular white matter lesion (WML) score greater than 2 in the stroke group, the proportion of patients with a deep WML score of 2, and the average age of patients in the stroke group were much higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05).

A better method of assessing ventricular performance is needed to aid understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms and guide management in conditions such as heart failure. In this study, we propose two novel measures to quantify myocardial performance, the global longitudinal active strain energy (GLASE) and its density (GLASED) and compare them to existing measures in normal and diseased left ventricles. GLASED calculates the work done per unit volume of muscle (energy density) by combining information from myocardial strain and wall stress (contractile force per unit cross sectional area). Magnetic resonance images were obtained from 183 individuals forming four cohorts (normal, hypertension, dilated cardiomyopathy, and cardiac amyloidosis). GLASE and GLASED were compared with the standard ejection fraction, the corrected ejection fraction, myocardial strains, stroke work and myocardial forces. Myocardial shortening was decreased in all disease cohorts. Longitudinal stress was normal in hypertension, increased in dilated cardiomyopathy and severely decreased in amyloid heart disease. GLASE was increased in hypertension. GLASED was mildly reduced in hypertension (1.39 +/- 0.65 kJ/m3), moderately reduced in dilated cardiomyopathy (0.86 +/- 0.45 kJ/m3) and severely reduced in amyloid heart disease (0.42 +/- 0.28 kJ/m3) compared to the control cohort (1.94 +/- 0.49 kJ/m3). GLASED progressively decreased in the hypertension, dilated cardiomyopathy and cardiac amyloid cohorts indicating that mechanical work done and systolic performance is severely reduced in cardiac amyloid despite the relatively preserved ejection fraction. GLASED provides a new technique for assessing left ventricular myocardial health and contractile function. Copyright © 2022.

Limited data are available regarding the influence of MD on short-term prognosis. We assessed the impact of the MD adherence on in-hospital and short-term outcome in patients with first ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)., METHODS AND RESULTS: As many as 533 European patients with STEMI and no previous history of coronary artery disease were included in this analysis. Previous dietary habits of each patient were collected with a food frequency questionnaire from which we calculated the FAMI Mediterranean Diet Score (FAMI MD Score), according to the MD adherence. A blood sample was drawn to each patient within 6 h of symptoms onset. Levels of high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP), Interleukin-6 (IL-6) were measured. Clinical outcome at 180 days and myocardial reperfusion were assessed. Patients with higher FAMI MD Score had lower levels of hsCRP; there were no differences between IL-6 level among FAMI MD Score quintiles. There were no associations between adherence to MD and 180-day adverse events. Lower FAMI MD Score was associated with a higher risk of ineffective myocardial reperfusion after thrombolysis or percutaneous coronary intervention. Similar results were observed for daily consumption of >=4 portions of fruit and vegetable., CONCLUSIONS: A positive effect of the Mediterranean diet, and fruit and vegetable intake was observed on hsCRP and the occurrence of effective myocardial reperfusion. These findings confirm the favorable impact of Mediterranean diet adherence not only in primary but also in secondary prevention.

Given that coagulation is involved in the thrombus formation stage on atherosclerotic plaque rupture, we hypothesized that factor V Leiden may be a stronger risk factor for atherothrombotic events in patients with established CHD., METHODS: We performed an individual-level meta-analysis including 25 prospective studies (18 cohorts, 3 case-cohorts, 4 randomized trials) from the GENIUS-CHD (Genetics of Subsequent Coronary Heart Disease) consortium involving patients with established CHD at baseline. Participating studies genotyped factor V Leiden status and shared risk estimates for the outcomes of interest using a centrally developed statistical code with harmonized definitions across studies. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to obtain age- and sex-adjusted estimates. The obtained estimates were pooled using fixed-effect meta-analysis. The primary outcome was composite of myocardial infarction and CHD death. Secondary outcomes included any stroke, ischemic stroke, coronary revascularization, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality., RESULTS: The studies included 69 681 individuals of whom 3190 (4.6%) were either heterozygous or homozygous (n=47) carriers of factor V Leiden. Median follow-up per study ranged from 1.0 to 10.6 years. A total of 20 studies with 61 147 participants and 6849 events contributed to analyses of the primary outcome. Factor V Leiden was not associated with the combined outcome of myocardial infarction and CHD death (hazard ratio, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.92-1.16]; I2=28%; P-heterogeneity=0.12). Subgroup analysis according to baseline characteristics or strata of traditional cardiovascular risk factors did not show relevant differences. Similarly, risk estimates for the secondary outcomes including stroke, coronary revascularization, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality were also close to identity., CONCLUSIONS: Factor V Leiden was not associated with increased risk of subsequent atherothrombotic events and mortality in high-risk participants with established and treated CHD. Routine assessment of factor V Leiden status is unlikely to improve atherothrombotic events risk stratification in this population.","Authors":"Mahmoodi, Bakhtawar K.; Tragante, Vinicius; Kleber, Marcus E.; Holmes, Michael V.; Schmidt, Amand F.; McCubrey, Raymond O.; Howe, Laurence J.; Direk, Kenan; Allayee, Hooman; Baranova, Ekaterina V.; Braund, Peter S.; Delgado, Graciela E.; Eriksson, Niclas; Gijsberts, Crystel M.; Gong, Yan; Hartiala, Jaana; Heydarpour, Mahyar; Pasterkamp, Gerard; Kotti, Salma; Kuukasjarvi, Pekka; Lenzini, Petra A.; Levin, Daniel; Lyytikainen, Leo-Pekka; Muehlschlegel, Jochen D.; Nelson, Christopher P.; Nikus, Kjell; Pilbrow, Anna P.; Wilson Tang, W.

Guidelines recommend a workup for TIA-patients similar to that of stroke patients, including an assessment of the extra- and intracranial arteries for vascular pathologies with direct therapeutic implications via computed tomography angiography (CTA). Aim of our study was a systematic analysis of TIA-patients receiving early CTA-imaging and to evaluate the predictive value of TIA-scores and clinical characteristics for ipsilateral vascular pathologies and the need of an invasive treatment. Method(s): We analysed clinical and imaging data from TIA patients being admitted to a tertiary university hospital between September 2015 and March 2018. Following subgroups were identified: 1) no- or low-grade vascular pathology 2) ipsilateral high-risk vascular pathology and 3) high-risk findings that needed invasive, surgical or interventional treatment. We investigated established TIA-scores (ABCD2-, the ABCD3- and the SPI-II score) and various clinical characteristics as predictive factors for ipsilateral vascular pathologies and the need for invasive treatment. Result(s): Of 812 patients, 531 (65.4%) underwent initial CTA in the emergency department. In 121 (22.8%) patients, ipsilateral vascular pathologies were identified, of which 36 (6.7%) needed invasive treatment. The ABCD2-, ABCD3- and SPI-II-scores were not predictive for ipsilateral vascular pathologies or the need for invasive treatment. We identified male sex (OR 1.579, 95%CI 1.049-2.377, p = 0.029), a short duration of symptoms (OR 0.692, 95% CI 0.542-0.884, p = 0.003), arterial hypertension (OR 1.718, 95%CI 0.951-3.104, p = 0.073) and coronary heart disease (OR 1.916, 95%CI 1.184-3.101, p = 0.008) as predictors for ipsilateral vascular pathologies. As predictors for the need of invasive treatment, a short duration of symptoms (OR 0.565, 95%CI 0.378-0.846, p = 0.006), arterial hypertension (OR 2.612, 95%OR 0.895-7.621, p = 0.079) and hyperlipidaemia (OR 5.681, 95%CI 0.766-42.117, p = 0.089) as well as the absence of atrial fibrillation (OR 0.274, OR 0.082-0.917, p = 0.036) were identified. Conclusion(s): More than every fifth TIA-patient had relevant vascular findings revealed by acute CTA. TIA-scores were not predictive for these findings. Patients with a short duration of symptoms and a vascular risk profile including coronary heart disease, arterial hypertension and hyperlipidaemia most likely might benefit from early CTA to streamline further diagnostics and therapy.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).","Authors":"Maier, I.

We assessed the discriminatory strength of NT-proBNP by itself for death and cardiovascular events in high-risk patients with T2DM. Methods and Results Cox proportional hazards were used to create a base model formed by 20 variables. The discriminatory ability of the base model was compared with that of NT-proBNP alone and with NT-proBNP added, using C-statistics. We studied 5509 patients (with complete data) of 8561 patients with T2DM and cardiovascular and/or chronic kidney disease who were enrolled in the ALTITUDE (Aliskiren in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiorenal Endpoints) trial. During a median 2.6-year follow-up period, 469 patients died and 768 had a cardiovascular composite outcome (cardiovascular death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, or heart failure hospitalization). NT-proBNP alone was as discriminatory as the base model for predicting death (C-statistic, 0.745 versus 0.744, P=0.95) and the cardiovascular composite outcome (C-statistic, 0.723 versus 0.731, P=0.37). When NT-proBNP was added, it increased the predictive ability of the base model for death (C-statistic, 0.779 versus 0.744, P<0.001) and for cardiovascular composite outcome (C-statistic, 0.763 versus 0.731, P<0.001). Conclusions In high-risk patients with T2DM, NT-proBNP by itself demonstrated discriminatory ability similar to a multivariable model in predicting both death and cardiovascular events and should be considered for risk stratification.

The atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) is a marker for CAD severity and progression. However, little is known about its contribution to the residual risk of CAD observed in the absence of all typical risk factors., METHODS: A prospective cohort study of 366 Indian patients undergoing coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography and diagnosed with stable CAD. Diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, previous CAD, alcohol or lipid-lowering medication intake, renal, liver or thyroid dysfunction were exclusion criteria. Coronary stenosis was graded using the CAD-reporting and data system (CAD-RADS TM) system. Lipid profile, HbA1c, uric acid, highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and anthropometric measurements were taken. AIP, triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc) and total cholesterol (Tc)/HDLc ratios were calculated. Independent predictors of CAD severity and the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) during 2.57 (0.52) years of follow-up were identified using logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression., RESULTS: Sixty patients experienced a MACE during a cumulative 887.03 person-years. HbA1c, uric acid, hsCRP, Tc/HDLc and AIP were independent predictors of severe coronary lesions (CAD-RADS 4,5) on multivariate analysis with odds ratio 4.52 (2.37-8.61), 1.41 (1.08-1.84), 1.33 (1.09-1.62), 1.76 (1.27-2.44) and 1.29 (1.11-1.50), respectively. Only AIP and Tc/HDLc were independent predictors of MACE with hazard ratios of 1.41 (1.20-1.65) and 1.78 (1.33-2.39) besides patient age and CAD severity., CONCLUSION: AIP is associated with both the severity of CAD and the occurrence of MACE within 3 years. It could serve as an effective marker of residual risk of CAD in patients devoid of traditional risk factors. Lipid-profile ratios, such as AIP are cost-effective and accessible parameters suitable for low and middle-income settings. Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Hemodynamic gain index (HGI) is a recent sensitive indicator of ischemia and has been associated with increased mortality. This study evaluated the clinical impact of HGI in patients who underwent concomitant exercise stress testing and coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA)., METHODS: A total of 284 consecutive patients from the executive health program between 2010 and 2018 were identified. Resting and peak heart rate (HR) as well as systolic blood pressure (SBP) measurements were recorded. Framingham risk score (FRS), Duke treadmill score (DTS) and HGI [Formula: see text] were calculated. The latter was divided into quartiles. CCTA was used as a reference test to detect any CAD. Multivariate analysis and artificial neural network were used to determine the independent predictors of obstructive CAD., RESULTS: Mean age was 53 +/- 12 years with 83% male. Mean HGI was 1.74 +/- 0.67, with cut-off value of severely blunted HGI <= 1.25 (Quartile 4). Patients with severely blunted HGI were older, had higher FRS, and worse DTS. Patients with obstructive CAD had lower HGI when compared to those with normal CCTA/non-obstructive CAD (1.36 +/- 0.53 vs. 1.77 +/- 0.67, P = 0.005), and showed a higher prevalence of severely blunted HGI (44% vs. 22%, P = 0.019). After adjusting for traditional risk factors, HGI remained an independent predictor of obstructive CAD while severely blunted HGI was associated with threefold increased odds of having obstructive CAD (P = 0.05). Using artificial intelligence analysis, severely blunted HGI independently predicted obstructive CAD with an area under the curve of 0.83 and 0.96, and normalized importance of HGI of 100% and 63%, respectively for different models., CONCLUSIONS: Among patients who underwent concomitant exercise stress testing and CCTA, severely blunted HGI independently predicted obstructive CAD after multivariate adjustment for traditional risk factors.

An increase in biomarkers and protein levels in response to AMI can be used as a predictive biomarker with different sensitivities and specificities. This study aimed at investigating the role of miR-19a as a biomarker with acceptable sensitivity and specificity for early diagnosis of AMI., METHODS: We studied 175 patients with AMI admitted within 12 h of symptom onset and 90 healthy subjects as control group. Patients were divided into two groups, including group I (normal vessels and no significant artery stenosis) and primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) group II (patients with more than 50% stenosis in vessels and severe atherosclerosis) diagnosed by angiography. The expression level of miR-19a was evaluated by the real-time polymerase chain reaction and other serum chemistries were also analyzed., RESULTS: The results demonstrated that circulating miR-19a levels were significantly increased in patient groups compared to the control group (2.88 +/- 1.06 vs. 5.93 +/- 1.28, P<0.0001). We also found that miR-19a levels were higher in group II (134.62-fold) than group I (15.42-fold).

The study group was composed of 102 women and 67 men with type 2 diabetes, having their glycemic and metabolic parameters assessed. All were on oral antidiabetic drugs. Serum levels of NT-proBNP and PIGF-1 were measured by electro-hemi-luminescence on an Elecsys 2010 analyzer. Enzymatic immunoassays were used for ADMA and ET-1. The Framingham Risk Score (FRS), the UKPDS 2.0 and the ADVANCE risk engines were used to calculate cardiovascular risks while statistical analysis was performed on SPSS. Levels of PIGF-1 showed no correlation with the calculated CV risks. The same was true for ADMA, except for a weak correlation with the UKPDS-based 10-year risk for stroke (Pearsons's R=0.167, p=0.039). Plasma levels of ET-1 were correlated with the UKPDS-based 10-year risk for stroke (R=0.184, p=0.032) and fatal stroke (R=0.215, p=0.012) only. NT-proBNP was significantly correlated with all CV risk calculations: ADVANCE-based 4-yr risk (Spearman's Rho=0.521, p<0.001); UKPDS-based 10-year risk for: CHD (Rho=0.209, p=0.01), fatal CHD (Rho=0.282, p<0.001), stroke (Rho=0.482, p<0.001), fatal stroke (Rho=0.505, p<0.001); and 10-year FRS risk (Rho=0.246, p=0.002). In conclusion, ADMA and PIGF-1 did not seem useful in stratifying CV risk while ET-1 is linked to the risk of stroke, and NT-proBNP to all CV risk estimations.Copyright © 2021 Georg Thieme Verlag.

A 27-single-nucleotide polymorphism genetic risk score defined low (quintile 1), intermediate (quintiles 2-4), and high (quintile 5) genetic risk. Patients were also categorized by major atherosclerotic risk factors including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol >=100 mg/dl, and smoking; multiple (>=2) risk factors was considered high clinical risk. Outcomes consisted of major coronary events (coronary heart death, myocardial infarction, or coronary revascularization) and major vascular events (major coronary events and ischemic stroke). Median follow-up was 2.3 years., RESULTS: After we adjusted for clinical factors, the genetic risk score was associated with risk for both major vascular events (Ptrend=0.005) and major coronary events (Ptrend<0.0001). Individuals with intermediate and high genetic risk scores had 1.23- and 1.65-fold increased hazard for major coronary events, respectively. Elevated genetic risk was additive to major atherosclerotic risk factors and identified patients more likely to benefit from evolocumab. There was no benefit for major vascular events in patients without multiple clinical risk factors or high genetic risk (hazard ratio [HR], 1.02; absolute risk reduction [ARR], -0.2%, P=0.86). In contrast, there was a 13% relative risk reduction (HR, 0.87 [0.75-0.998], P=0.047) and a 1.4% ARR in patients with multiple clinical risk factors but without high genetic risk and a 31% relative risk reduction (HR, 0.69 [0.55-0.86], P=0.0012), and 4.0% ARR in patients with high genetic risk, irrespective of clinical risk (Ptrend for HR=0.017, ARR Ptrend=0.004). Patients with high genetic risk who received evolocumab had event rates similar to patients with a low burden of both genetic and clinical risk., CONCLUSION: Patients without multiple clinical risk factors or high genetic risk had a low event rate and did not appear to derive benefit from evolocumab over 2.3 years. Conversely, patients with multiple clinical risk factors but without high genetic risk had intermediate risk and intermediate risk reduction. Patients with high genetic risk, regardless of clinical risk, had a high event rate and derived the greatest relative and absolute benefit from evolocumab, which mitigated this risk.","Authors":"Marston, Nicholas A.; Kamanu, Frederick K.; Nordio, Francesco; Gurmu, Yared; Roselli, Carolina; Sever, Peter S.; Pedersen, Terje R.; Keech, Anthony C.; Wang, Huei; Lira Pineda, Armando; Giugliano, Robert P.; Lubitz, Steven A.; Ellinor, Patrick T.; Sabatine, Marc S.; Ruff, Christian T.","Publisher":"Circulation","Issue":"8","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.043805","Pages":"616-623","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"27 single nucleotide polymorphism genetic risk score"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":3,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":18,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":2430,"Title":"NT-proBNP Levels Influence the Prognostic Value of Mineral Metabolism Biomarkers in Coronary Artery Disease","Year":2022,"Country":"","Abstract":"Background. Mineral metabolism (MM) system and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-ProBNP) have been shown to add prognostic value in patients with stable coronary artery disease (SCAD). However, the influence of NT-ProBNP on the prognostic role of MM in patients with SCAD has not been shown yet. The objective of this study is to assess the influence of NT-ProBNP on the prognostic role of MM markers in patients with SCAD. Method(s): We analyzed the prognostic value of MM markers (parathormone (PTH), klotho, phosphate, calcidiol (25-hydroxyvitamin D3), and fibroblast growth factor-23) in 964 patients with SCAD and NT-ProBNP > 125 pg/mL vs. patient with NT-ProBNP <= 125 pg/mL included in five hospitals in Spain. The main outcome was the combination of death, heart failure, and ischemic events (any acute coronary syndrome, ischemic stroke, or transient ischemic attack). Result(s): A total of 622 patients had NT-proBNP > 125 pg/mL and 342 patients had NT-ProBNP <= 125 pg/mL. The median follow-up was 5.1 years. In the group of NT-proBNP > 125 pg/mL, the patients were older, and there were more females and smokers than in the group of patients with normal NT-proBNP. Additionally, the proportion of patients with hypertension, atrial fibrillation, ejection fraction < 40%, cerebrovascular attack, or prior coronary artery bypass graft was higher in the high NT-proBNP group. In the high NT-proBNP patients, the predictors of poor prognosis were PTH (HR = 1.06 (1.01-1.10), p < 0.001) and NT-proBNP (HR = 1.02 (1.01-1.03), p = 0.011), along with age (HR = 1.039 (1.02-1.06), p < 0.001), prior coronary artery bypass graft (HR = 1.624 (1.02-2.59), p = 0.041), treatment with statins (HR = 0.32 (0.19-0.53), p < 0.001), insulin (HR = 2.49 (1.59-4.09), p < 0.001), angiotensin receptor blockers (HR = 1.73 (1.16-2.56), p = 0.007), nitrates (HR = 1.65 (1.10-2.45), p = 0.014), and proton pump inhibitors (HR = 2.75 (1.74-4.36), p < 0.001). In the NT-proBNP <= 125 pg/mL subgroup, poor prognosis predictors were plasma levels of non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol (HR = 1.01 (1.00-1.02), p = 0.014) and calcidiol (HR = 0.96 (0.92-0.99), p = 0.045), as well as treatment with verapamil (HR = 11.28 (2.54-50.00), p = 0.001), and dihydropyridines (HR = 3.16 (1.63-6.13), p = 0.001). Conclusion(s): In patients with SCAD and NT-ProBNP > 125 pg/mL, PTH and NT-ProBNP, which are markers related to ventricular damage, are predictors of poor outcome. In the subgroup of patients with NT-ProBNP <= 125 pgm/L, calcidiol and non-HDL cholesterol, which are more related to vascular damage, are the independent predictors of poor outcome. Then, in patients with SCAD, baseline NT-ProBNP may influence the type of biomarker that is effective in risk prediction.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.","Authors":"Martinez-Milla, J.; Acena, A.; Pello, A.; Lopez-Castillo, M.; Gaebelt, H.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether the SUA levels could affect the incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)., METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively examined the clinical records of 1,949 patients who underwent successful PCI. First, they were divided into two groups based on an SUA level of 7.0mg/dl. Among the two groups, the incidence of MACE was measured for a maximum of 5 years after PCI. Next, we divided them into 6 groups at SUA intervals of 1.0mg/dl and estimated the hazard ratios of each group. The Kaplan-Meier curve demonstrated that patients with SUA levels of >7.0mg/dl had a higher incidence of MACE than those with 7.0mg/dl or less. However, according to the multivariate analysis, the SUA level was not significantly correlated with the incidence of MACE because other factors could strongly affect it. Meanwhile, the group with SUA levels between 4.1-5.0mg/dl had a lower hazard ratio compared to groups with SUA levels of more than 5.1mg/dl. However, the hazard ratio of the group with SUA levels of 4.0mg or less was not lower than that of the group with SUA levels of 4.1-5.0mg/dl. Even after adjustment for several parameters, nearly the same results before adjustment were obtained for the hazard ratios of each group., CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated that the SUA level was one of the most valuable predictors of cardiovascular events after PCI, with elevated SUA levels adversely affecting secondary prevention.

However, deep lipid profiles of major chronic inflammatory diseases have not been compared. Method(s): Plasma lipidomes of patients suffering from two etiologically distinct chronic inflammatory diseases, atherosclerosis-related vascular disease, including cardiovascular (CVD) and ischemic stroke (IS), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), were screened by a top-down shotgun mass spectrometry-based analysis without liquid chromatographic separation and compared to each other and to age-matched controls. Lipid profiling of 596 lipids was performed on a cohort of 427 individuals. Machine learning classifiers based on the plasma lipidomes were used to distinguish the two chronic inflammatory diseases from each other and from the controls. Finding(s): Analysis of the lipidomes enabled separation of the studied chronic inflammatory diseases from controls based on independent validation test set classification performance (CVD vs control - Sensitivity: 0.94, Specificity: 0.88; IS vs control - Sensitivity: 1.0, Specificity: 1.0; SLE vs control - Sensitivity: 1, Specificity: 0.93) and from each other (SLE vs CVD - Sensitivity: 0.91, Specificity: 1; IS vs SLE - Sensitivity: 1, Specificity: 0.82). Preliminary linear discriminant analysis plots using all data clearly separated the clinical groups from each other and from the controls, and partially separated CVD severities, as classified into five clinical groups. Dysregulated lipids are partially but not fully counterbalanced by statin treatment. Interpretation(s): Dysregulation of the plasma lipidome is characteristic of chronic inflammatory diseases. Lipid profiling accurately identifies the diseases and in the case of CVD also identifies sub-classes.

By quickly and efficiently extracting imaging data from the health records, natural language processing (NLP) has the potential to substantially improve how we study and care for patients with AAAs. The aim of the present study was to test the ability of an NLP tool to accurately identify the presence or absence of AAAs and detect the maximal abdominal aortic diameter in a large dataset of imaging study reports. Method(s): Relevant imaging study reports (n = 230,660) from 2003 to 2017 were obtained for 32,778 patients followed up in a prospective aneurysm surveillance registry within a large, diverse, integrated healthcare system. A commercially available NLP algorithm was used to assess the presence of AAAs, confirm the absence of AAAs, and extract the maximal diameter of the abdominal aorta, if stated. A blinded expert manual review of 18,000 randomly selected imaging reports was used as the reference standard. The positive predictive value (PPV or precision), sensitivity (recall), and the kappa statistics were calculated. Result(s): Of the randomly selected 18,000 studies that underwent expert manual review, 48.7% were positive for AAAs. In confirming the presence of an AAA, the interrater reliability of the NLP compared with the expert review showed a kappa value of 0.84 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83-0.85), with a PPV of 95% and sensitivity of 88.5%. The NLP algorithm showed similar results for confirming the absence of an AAA, with a kappa of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.799-0.80), PPV of 77.7%, and sensitivity of 91.9%. The kappa, PPV, and sensitivity of the NLP for correctly identifying the maximal aortic diameter was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.87-0.89), 88.8%, and 88.2% respectively. Conclusion(s): The use of NLP software can accurately analyze large volumes of radiology report data to detect AAA disease and assemble a contemporary aortic diameter-based cohort of patients for longitudinal analysis to guide surveillance, medical management, and operative decision making. It can also potentially be used to identify from the electronic medical records pre- and postoperative AAA patients \"lost to follow-up,\" leverage human resources engaged in the ongoing surveillance of patients with AAAs, and facilitate the construction and implementation of AAA screening programs.Copyright © 2021 Society for Vascular Surgery","Authors":"McLenon, M.; Okuhn, S.; Lancaster, E.

SOCS3 mRNA expression levels in peripheral blood cells were determined by a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and levels of the SOCS3 protein were determined by Western blotting. Result(s): The mRNA expression levels of the SOCS3 gene in AMI patients was 1.33-fold higher than that in the SCAD patients, and the level of the SOCS3 protein was 1.25-fold higher (p < 0.05 for both).

METHODS We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at 202 centers in China involving patients with a minor ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) who carried CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles. Patients were assigned within 24 hours after symptom onset, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive ticagrelor (180 mg on day 1 followed by 90 mg twice daily on days 2 through 90) and placebo clopidogrel or to receive clopidogrel (300 mg on day 1 followed by 75 mg once daily on days 2 through 90) and placebo ticagrelor; both groups received aspirin for 21 days. The primary efficacy outcome was new stroke, and the primary safety outcome was severe or moderate bleeding, both within 90 days. RESULTS A total of 11,255 patients were screened and 6412 patients were enrolled, with 3205 assigned to the ticagrelor group and 3207 to the clopidogrel group. The median age of the patients was 64.8 years, and 33.8% were women; 98.0% belonged to the Han Chinese ethnic group. Stroke occurred within 90 days in 191 patients (6.0%) in the ticagrelor group and 243 patients (7.6%) in the clopidogrel group (hazard ratio, 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.64 to 0.94; P=0.008). Secondary outcomes were generally in the same direction as the primary outcome. Severe or moderate bleeding occurred in 9 patients (0.3%) in the ticagrelor group and in 11 patients (0.3%) in the clopidogrel group; any bleeding occurred in 170 patients (5.3%) and 80 patients (2.5%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS Among Chinese patients with minor ischemic stroke or TIA who were carriers of CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles, the risk of stroke at 90 days was modestly lower with ticagrelor than with clopidogrel. The risk of severe or moderate bleeding did not differ between the two treatment groups, but ticagrelor was associated with more total bleeding events than clopidogrel.Copyright © 2021 Massachusetts Medical Society.","Authors":"Meng, X.; Wang, A.; Xie, X.; Pan, Y.; Johnston, S.

Recently, microbleeds have been identified as one of the factors leading to ICH. While some patients have been found to have recurrent ICH, risk factors for recurrent ICH are scarcely reported. We conducted an observational study on the risk-factors of recurrent ICH, comparing stroke patients with a single hemorrhagic episode and those with recurrent ICH. Method(s): A retrospective analysis of a single-center database was performed to analyze the clinical presentation and characteristics of patients with a single and recurrent ICH. From January 2016 to December 2017, a total of 317 patients were analyzed based on suspected factors including patients' sex, age, medical history, antiplatelet therapy use, and presence of microbleeds on images. Result(s): Of the 317 patients, 36 patients (11.4%) developed a second episode of cerebral hemorrhage. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the patients without microbleeds, predicted reduced risk of recurrence. This is the first report strongly associating the presence of microbleeds with the possibility of a recurrent ICH. Other factors under study did not show an apparent association with recurrent ICH probably because of the high statistical significance obtained with the presence of microbleeds. Conclusion(s): Our findings revealed that the absence of microbleeds on images is a factor that strongly predicts a reduced risk for recurrent ICH and that the detection of microbleeds on MRI performed in patients with a single hemorrhagic episode, is useful in defining further therapeutic management. These findings may benefit physicians treating stroke patients.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Authors":"Miki, K.; Natori, Y.; Kai, Y.; Yamada, T.; Mori, M.; Noguchi, N.; Koga, H.","Publisher":"Journal of Stroke and Cerebrovascular Diseases","Issue":"3","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2019.104585","Pages":"104585","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"microbleeds"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":18,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":25,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":34,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":2548,"Title":"Atrial fibrillation after ischemic stroke detected by chest strap-style 7-day holter monitoring and the risk predictors: Educateesus","Year":2021,"Country":"","Abstract":"Aim: This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic yield of 7-day Holter monitoring for detecting covert atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with recent embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS) and to identify the preentry screening biomarkers that had significant associations with later detection of AF (clinicaltrials.gov.

This study aimed to identify a group of ACS patients at a high risk of recurrent adverse cardiac events using the plasma NLRP3 inflammasome. Patients and Methods: ACS patients admitted to Liaocheng People's Hospital between June 2021 and March 2022 were enrolled in this study. Patients were divided into low (levels < 3.84 ng/mL) and high (levels >= 3.84 ng/mL) groups based on the median NLRP3 inflammasome levels. The patients were divided into three groups according to the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction Risk Score for Secondary Prevention (TRS-2P): low (scores <= 2 points), intermediate (scores = 3 points), and high (score >= 4 points) risk. We investigated the relationship between NLRP3 inflammasome and laboratory indicators. Additionally, we examined whether the NLRP3 inflammasome was an independent predictor of high TRS-2P and explored the applicability of the plasma NLRP3 inflammasome for predicting high TRS-2P. Result(s): Logistic regression analysis revealed that NLRP3 inflammasome was an independent predictor of high TRS-2P (odds ratio [OR]:2.013; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.174-3.452). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value of the NLRP3 inflammasome was 0.674 (95% CI: 0.611-0.737; P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): NLRP3 inflammasome levels are an independent predictive factor for high TRS-2P levels, which indicates that the NLRP3 inflammasome may help predict the prognosis of ACS patients.Copyright © 2022 Mo et al.","Authors":"Mo, D.

An early diagnosis is likely to help in the prevention and proper management of this disease. As the study of proteomics provides the potential markers for detection of a disease, in the present investigation, attempt has been made to identify disease-associated differential proteins involved in CAD pathogenesis. For this study, a total of 200 selected CAD patients were considered, who were recruited for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) treatment. The proteomic analysis was performed using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and MALDI-TOF MS/MS. Samples were also subjected to Western blot analysis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolation immunofluorescence (IF) analysis, analytical screening by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), and in silico analysis. The representative data were shown as mean +/- SD of at least three experiments. A total of 19 proteins were identified. Among them, the most abundant five proteins (serotransferrin, talin-1, alpha-2HS glycoprotein, transthyretin (TTR), fibrinogen-alpha chain) were found to have altered level in CAD. Serotransferrin, talin-1, alpha-2HS glycoprotein, and transthyretin (TTR) were found to have lower level, whereas fibrinogen-alpha chain was found to have higher level in CAD plasma compared to healthy, confirmed by Western blot analysis. TTR, an important acute phase transport protein, was validated low level in 200 CAD patients who confirmed to undergo PCI treatment. Further, in silico and in vitro studies of TTR indicated a downexpression of CAD in plasma as compared to the plasma of healthy individuals. Lower level of plasma TTR was determined to be an important risk marker in the atherosclerotic-approved CAD patients. We suggest that the TTR lower level predicts disease severity and hence may serve as an important marker tool for CAD screening. However, further large-scale studies are required to determine the clinical significance of TTR.

Heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP) has been identified as an early diagnostic marker of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). In this study, we examined the diagnostic and prognostic value of H-FABP in patients suspected with ACS., METHODS: We conducted an observational single-center cohort study, including 89 adults aged 30 years or older, who presented to the emergency room (ER) within 24 hours after the onset of chest pain and/or dyspnea. We performed laboratory analysis and point-of-care testing (POCT) for cardiac markers, including H-FABP, troponin I, and creatine kinase-myocardial band. We also evaluated the correlation between cardiac markers and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and extent of coronary artery disease (CAD)., RESULTS: In patients presented to ER within 4 hours after symptom onset (n = 49), the diagnostic accuracy of H-FABP for AMI, as quantified by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, was higher (0.738; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.591-0.885) than other cardiac markers. In POCT, the diagnostic accuracy of H-FABP (56%; 95% CI, 45-67) was significantly higher than other cardiac markers. H-FABP was correlated with not extent of CAD but post-AMI LV dysfunction., CONCLUSION: H-FABP is a useful cardiac marker for the early diagnosis of AMI and prediction of myocardia injury. Difference in the circulatory release timeline of cardiac markers could explain its utility in early-stage of myocardial injury.

Noninvasive imaging cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) can be used to diagnose myocarditis, but the interpretation is time-consuming and requires expert physicians. Computer-aided diagnostic systems can facilitate the automatic screening of CMR images for triage. This paper presents an automatic model for myocarditis classification based on a deep reinforcement learning approach called as reinforcement learning-based myocarditis diagnosis combined with population-based algorithm (RLMD-PA) that we evaluated using the Z-Alizadeh Sani myocarditis dataset of CMR images prospectively acquired at Omid Hospital, Tehran. This model addresses the imbalanced classification problem inherent to the CMR dataset and formulates the classification problem as a sequential decision-making process. The policy of architecture is based on convolutional neural network (CNN). To implement this model, we first apply the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm to obtain initial values for RLMD-PA weights. Next, the agent receives a sample at each step and classifies it. For each classification act, the agent gets a reward from the environment in which the reward of the minority class is greater than the reward of the majority class. Eventually, the agent finds an optimal policy under the guidance of a particular reward function and a helpful learning environment. Experimental results based on standard performance metrics show that RLMD-PA has achieved high accuracy for myocarditis classification, indicating that the proposed model is suitable for myocarditis diagnosis.Copyright © 2022 Seyed Vahid Moravvej et al.","Authors":"Moravvej, S.

Participants with TWA had increased risks of all-cause mortality (HR 1.45 [95% CI 1.30, 1.62], p < 0.0001), cardiovascular mortality (HR 1.93 [1.59, 2.34], p = 0.0001), congestive heart failure (HR 2.04 [1.69, 2.48], p < 0.0001) and major CHD (HR 1.40 [1.26, 1.57], p < 0.0001), but no increased risk of stroke (HR 0.99 [0.80, 1.23], p = 0.95). Major TWA conferred a higher risk than minor TWA. When TWA were added to the UK Prospective Diabetes Study risk engine, there was improved discrimination for incident CHD events, but only for those with prevalent CVD (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.5744 and 0.6030 with p = 0.0067). Adding TWA to the risk engine yielded improvements in reclassification that were of greater magnitude in those with prevalent CVD (net reclassification improvement [NRI] 0.24 [95% CI 0.16, 0.32] in those with prevalent CVD, NRI 0.14 [95% CI 0.07, 0.22] in those without prevalent CVD)., CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The presence and magnitude of TWA are associated with increased risk of clinical cardiovascular events and mortality in individuals with diabetes and may have value in refining risk, particularly in those with prevalent CVD.

The underlying genetic mechanisms have not been completely delineated, so better knowledge of the physiopathology of TAAs is needed to improve detection and therapy. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally and are known to be involved in cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The current study aimed to identify miRNAs that can be used as possible biomarkers for the early diagnosis of patients with ascending TAAs (ATAAs). MiRNA expression was profiled by NanoString nCounter technology using 12 samples including tissue and pre- and post-surgical plasma from ATAA patients. Four miRNAs were selected and further validated by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 22 plasma samples from which three miRNAs (hsa-miR140-5p, hsa-miR-191-5p and hsa-miR-214-3p) showed significant expression level differences between the two types of plasma samples. Further analyses of the corresponding predicted target genes by these miRNAs, revealed two genes (Myotubularin-related protein 4 (MTMR4) and Phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit beta (PPP1CB)) whose expression was inversely correlated with the expression of their respective miRNAs. Overall, in this pilot study, we identified three miRNAs that might serve as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets in ATAA.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

Early PAD diagnosis is important, as the only available causal therapy is addressing risk factors like smoking, hypercholesterolemia or hypertension. However, current diagnostic techniques often do not detect early stages of PAD. We theorize that PAD's underlying cause atherosclerosis can be detected on color fundus photography (CFP) images with a convolutional neural network architecture, which might aid earlier PAD diagnosis and improve disease monitoring. In this explorative study a deep attention-based Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) architecture is used to capture retinal imaging biomarkers on CFP images of 135 examinations. To capture subtle variations in vascular structures, higher image resolution can be utilized by partitioning the CFP into patches. Our architecture converts each patch into a feature vector, and determines its relative importance via an automatically computed attention weight. Our best model achieves an ROC AUC score of 0.890. Visualizing these attention weights provides insights about the network's decision and suggests ocular involvement in PAD. Statistical analysis confirms that the optic disc and the temporal arcades are weighted significantly higher (p < 0.001) than retinal background. Our results support the feasibility of detecting the presence of PAD with a modern deep learning approach. Copyright © 2022. The Author(s).","Authors":"Mueller, Simon; Wintergerst, Maximilian W.

Lipid biomarkers such as lipoprotein-a (Lp-a), Apo A1, Apo B and Paraoxonase-1 (PON1) serve as important risk predictors for development of CAD. There is little evidence regarding the role of lipid biomarkers and their genetic polymorphisms in young (<50 years) ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. Method(s): This study included 110 young (18-50 years) STEMI patients and 110 healthy controls. Serum levels of Apo A1, Apo B, Paraoxonase-1 (PON-1) and Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) were estimated for both patients as well as controls. Additionally, genetic polymorphisms in the Apo A1 (75G/A) and the PON1 (Q192R) genes were evaluated. Result(s): Serum levels of apo B (101.31 +/- 27.58 vs 75.31 +/- 18.77 mg/dl; p < 0.0001), Lp(a) [87.56 +/- 74.28 vs 25.81 +/- 24.66 mg/dl, p < 0.0001] and Lp-PLA2 [5.97 +/- 1.39 vs 3.49 +/- 1.27 ng/mL, p < 0.0001] were significantly higher in patients as compared to controls.

Most reported carotid plaque imaging techniques are 2-dimensional (2D) based with limited longitudinal coverage of =30 mm, which may be insufficient for complete visualization of extracranial carotid atheroma. A 3D black-blood imaging technique, motion-sensitized driven equilibrium prepared rapid gradient echo technique (3D-MERGE) can provide larger coverage. We sought to use 3D-MERGE to investigate carotid atherosclerosis plaque distribution and to analyze their correlation with clinical information and stroke risk factors. Methods-From 5 hospitals in China, 97 subjects suspected of recent stroke or transient ischemic attack were imaged with 3D-MERGE within 2 weeks of symptoms using 3T magnetic resonance imaging. Images were analyzed by 2 reviewers. Plaque length was calculated and categorized as plaques within, partially outside, or completely outside of typical 2D magnetic resonance imaging coverage. Associations between plaque features and clinical information, stroke risk factors were assessed. Results-Ninety-seven subjects with 194 carotid arteries (70 men and 27 women, mean age 60 years) were analyzed. Of the 136 plaques identified, 68 (50%) were within, 46 (33.8%) were partially outside, and 22 (16.2%) were completely outside of 2D magnetic resonance imaging coverage. Total plaque length was significantly positively associated with male sex (P<0.001), hypertension (P=0.011), and history of smoking (P<0.001). Hypertensive subjects were more likely to have at least one plaque completely outside the 2D magnetic resonance imaging coverage than nonhypertensive subjects (P=0.007). Conclusions-The 3D-MERGE allows for the identification of substantially more carotid plaques than 2D black-blood techniques. The extent and distribution of plaque, identified by the larger coverage afforded by 3D-MERGE, were found to correlate significantly with male sex and risk factors that are common among patients with stroke, including hypertension and history of cigarette smoking.Copyright © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Using multivariate Cox regression analysis, we evaluated the risk of stroke. Result(s): Of 505 patients with ICH with magnetic resonance imaging, 466 were included. DWI lesions were noted in 214 (45.9%) subjects, and 34 incident strokes (20 ischemic stroke and 14 recurrent ICH) were observed during a median follow-up of 324 days (interquartile range, 91-374).

Design and methods: This observational cross-sectional study included 112 patients with T1DM from a larger cohort (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02910271), selected (1:2) as per the presence of aPAD (n = 37) or not (n = 75). aPAD was evaluated by ankle-brachial index (ABI), toe-brachial index (TBI), and peripheral Doppler ultrasound. The two groups of patients were matched by age, gender distribution and duration of T1DM. Fasting serum copeptin was measured by high-sensitivity ELISA, and its relationships with clinical and biochemical variables as well as aPAD were evaluated too. Result(s): The study population was aged 42 +/- 8 years, duration of T1DM was 27 +/- 7 years, and mean HbA1c was 7.7 +/- 1.1%. No significant differences in copeptin concentrations were found between patients with or without aPAD (16.9 +/- 10.8 vs 17.3 +/- 14.7 pmol/L, respectively; P = 0.462). Considering all patients as a whole, copeptin correlated with systolic blood pressure (SBP; rho = -0.209, P = 0.027), eGFR rho = -0.271, P = 0.004), and serum sodium (rho = -0.208, P = 0.027), but not with ABI (rho = -0.068, P = 0.476). Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis (R2: 0.059; P = 0.035) retained SBP (beta: -0.219, 95% CI: -1.391; -0.089) as the only significant predictor of copeptin concentration. Conclusion(s): As serum copeptin does not appear to be associated with aPAD in patients with T1DM, further studies are now needed to elucidate whether it has any other potential role to play in the subclinical vascular disease of this patient population.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS","Authors":"Nattero-Chavez, L.; Martinez-Garcia, M.

We evaluated the prognostic value of GDF-15 in outpatients with cardiovascular risk factors. METHODS AND RESULTS: GDF-15 levels were measured in 3562 outpatients with cardiovascular risk factors in the J-HOP (Japan Morning Surge-Home Blood Pressure) study, a nationwide prospective study. Participants were stratified according to tertiles of GDF-15 and followed up for all-cause death and cardiovascular disease. During a mean follow-up period of 6.6 years, there were 155 all-cause deaths, 81 stroke events including cerebral infarction and intracranial hemorrhage, and 141 cardiac events including cardiac artery disease and heart failure. Patients with higher GDF-15 levels were associated with risks of all-cause death and stroke events (except for cardiac events) after adjustment for traditional risk factors and other prognostic biomarkers (NT-proBNP [N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide], high-sensitivity troponin T; all-cause death, hazard ratio, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.26-4.48; P=0.007; stroke events, hazard ratio, 2.93; 95% CI, 1.31-6.56, P=0.009; compared with the lowest tertile). Furthermore, incorporating GDF-15 to the predictive models for all-cause death improved discrimination and reclassification significantly. For stroke events, GDF-15 showed similar diagnostic accuracy to NT-proBNP and high-sensitivity troponin T. CONCLUSION(S): In Japanese outpatients with cardiovascular risk factors, GDF-15 improves risk stratification for all-cause death when compared with NT-proBNP and high-sensitivity troponin T. GDF-15 was associated with increased risks of stroke events beyond conventional risk factors and other prognostic markers; however, the predictive ability for stroke events was equivalent to NT-proBNP and high-sensitivity troponin T.

PAD is a strong predictor of future cardiovascular events, which can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Resistin has been found to be involved in pathological processes leading to CVD. Therefore, we aim to investigate whether resistin level is correlated with PAD in patients with non-dialysis CKD stage 3 to 5. There were 240 CKD patients enrolled in this study. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) values were measured using the automated oscillometric method. An ABI value < 0.9 defined the low ABI group. Serum levels of human resistin were determined using a commercially available enzyme immunoassay. Thirty CKD patients (12.5%) were included in the low ABI group. Patients in the low ABI group were older and had higher resistin levels as well as higher diabetes mellitus, hypertension and habit of smoking, and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate than patients in the normal ABI group. After the adjustment for factors that were significantly associated with PAD by multivariate logistic regression analysis, age and serum resistin level were independent predictors of PAD. A high serum resistin level is an independent predictor of PAD in non-dialysis CKD stage 3 to 5.","Authors":"Ng, Xin-Ning; Tang, Chi-Chong; Wang, Chih-Hsien; Tsai, Jen-Pi; Hsu, Bang-Gee","Publisher":"International journal of environmental research and public health","Issue":"23","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182312746","Pages":"Not Available","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"serum resistin"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":3,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":24,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":25,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":31,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":34,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":37,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":2716,"Title":"Emerging Detection Techniques for Large Vessel Occlusion Stroke: A Scoping Review","Year":2022,"Country":"","Abstract":"Background: Large vessel occlusion (LVO) is the obstruction of large, proximal cerebral arteries and can account for up to 46% of acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) when both the A2 and P2 segments are included (from the anterior and posterior cerebral arteries). It is of paramount importance that LVO is promptly recognised to provide timely and effective acute stroke management. This review aims to scope recent literature to identify new emerging detection techniques for LVO. As a good comparator throughout this review, the commonly used National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), at a cut-off of >=11, has been reported to have a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 60% for LVO. Method(s): Four electronic databases (Medline via OVID, CINAHL, Scopus, and Web of Science), and grey literature using OpenGrey, were systematically searched for published literature investigating developments in detection methods for LVO, reported from 2015 to 2021. The protocol for the search was published with the Open Science Framework (10.17605/OSF.IO/A98KN). Two independent researchers screened the titles, abstracts, and full texts of the articles, assessing their eligibility for inclusion. Result(s): The search identified 5,082 articles, in which 2,265 articles were screened to assess their eligibility. Sixty-two studies remained following full-text screening. LVO detection techniques were categorised into 5 groups: stroke scales (n = 30), imaging and physiological methods (n = 15), algorithmic and machine learning approaches (n = 9), physical symptoms (n = 5), and biomarkers (n = 3). Conclusion(s): This scoping review has explored literature on novel and advancements in pre-existing detection methods for LVO. The results of this review highlight LVO detection techniques, such as stroke scales and biomarkers, with good sensitivity and specificity performance, whilst also showing advancements to support existing LVO confirmatory methods, such as neuroimaging.Copyright © 2022 Nicholls, Ince, Minhas and Chung.","Authors":"Nicholls, J.

Thus, we evaluated the predictive value of soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) levels for cardiovascular mortality and nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients with CAD. Methods and Results Plasma levels of suPAR were measured in a cohort of 1703 patients with documented CAD as evidenced by coronary angiography-including 626 patients with acute coronary syndrome and 1077 patients with stable angina pectoris. Cardiovascular death and/or nonfatal myocardial infarction were defined as main outcome measures. During a median follow-up of 3.5 years, suPAR levels reliably predicted cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction in CAD, evidenced by survival curves stratified for tertiles of suPAR levels. In Cox regression analyses, the hazard ratio for the prediction of cardiovascular death and/or myocardial infarction was 2.19 (P<0.001) in the overall cohort and 2.56 in the acute coronary syndrome cohort (P<0.001).

Cardiac troponins as well as C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and natriuretic peptides have emerged as biomarkers for risk stratification. The question remains if one of these biomarkers is superior in predicting adverse outcomes. Thus, we perform a head-to-head comparison between high-sensitivity troponin I (hsTnI), hsCRP, and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in patients with CAD. Plasma levels were measured in a cohort of 2193 patients with documented CAD. The main outcome measures were cardiovascular (CV) death and/or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI). During a median follow-up of 3.8 years, all three biomarkers were associated with cardiovascular death and/or MI. After adjustments for conventional cardiovascular risk factors, the hazard ratio (HR) per standard deviation (SD) for the prediction of CV death and/or nonfatal MI was 1.39 [95% CI: 1.24-1.57, p < 0.001] for hsTnI, 1.41 [95% CI: 1.24-1.60, p < 0.001] for hsCRP, and 1.64 [95% CI: 1.39-1.92, p < 0.001] for NT-proBNP.

However, the value of screening for subclinical CAD with cardiac CT in AF patients is unknown. Between 2011 and 2015, 94 consecutive patients without known or suspected CAD (66 (57-73) years, 68% male), who were referred for AF evaluation, underwent a noncontrast-enhanced coronary calcium scan and a coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) at our center. We retrospectively evaluated the coronary calcium score, the prevalence of obstructive CAD (>=50% stenosis) determined by CCTA, compared clinical management and 5-year outcome in patients with and without obstructive CAD on CCTA, and examined the potential impact of a coronary calcium score and obstructive CAD on CCTA as a manifestation of vascular disease on the CHA2Ds2VASc score and for the cardiovascular risk stratification of AF patients. The median coronary calcium score was 57 (0-275) and 24 patients (26%) had obstructive CAD on CCTA. At baseline, patients with obstructive CAD more often used statins than those without obstructive CAD (54% vs 26%, p=0.011). After a median clinical follow-up of 2.4 (0.5-4.5) years, patients with obstructive CAD more frequently used oral anticoagulant and/or antiplatelet drugs, statins, angiotensin-II-receptor blockers and/or angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, and less often used class I antiarrhythmic drugs than patients without obstructive CAD (all p <0.050). After a median follow-up of 5.7 (4.8-6.8) years, mortality was higher in patients with obstructive CAD than in those without obstructive CAD (29% vs 11%, log-rank test: p=0.034). Implementation of a coronary calcium score and/or obstructive CAD on CCTA elevated the CHA2Ds2VASc score and cardiovascular risk stratification in 42 patients (p <0.001) and 47 patients (p=0.006), respectively. In conclusion, we observed a high prevalence of obstructive CAD on CCTA in AF patients without known or suspected CAD. AF patients with obstructive CAD were managed differently and had a worse prognosis than those without obstructive CAD. Cardiac CT could enhance cardiovascular risk stratification of AF patients.

Advances in high-throughput plasma proteomics, analysed with machine learning techniques, may offer new opportunities to further improve risk stratification in these patients Methods Targeted plasma proteomics was performed in two secondary prevention cohorts: the Second Manifestations of and results ARTerial disease (SMART) cohort (n = 870) and the Athero-Express cohort (n = 700). The primary outcome was recurrent ASCVD (acute myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, and cardiovascular death). Machine learning techniques with extreme gradient boosting were used to construct a protein model in the derivation cohort (SMART), which was validated in the Athero-Express cohort and compared with a clinical risk model. Pathway analysis was performed to identify specific pathways in high and low C-reactive protein (CRP) patient subsets. The protein model outperformed the clinical model in both the derivation cohort [area under the curve (AUC): 0.810 vs. 0.750; P, 0.001] and validation cohort (AUC: 0.801 vs. 0.765; P, 0.001), provided significant net reclassification improvement (0.173 in validation cohort) and was well calibrated. In contrast to a clear interleukin-6 signal in high CRP patients, neutrophil-signalling-related proteins were associated with recurrent ASCVD in low CRP patients Conclusion A proteome-based risk model is superior to a clinical risk model in predicting recurrent ASCVD events. Neutrophilrelated pathways were found in low CRP patients, implying the presence of a residual inflammatory risk beyond traditional NLRP3 pathways. The observed net reclassification improvement illustrates the potential of proteomics when incorporated in a tailored therapeutic approach in secondary prevention patients.Copyright © The Author(s) 2022.

Population-based prospective study including 4161 individuals (53.2% women) from the Tromso study with two valid ultrasound measurements of the AD and no AAA at baseline (Tromso 4, 1994). The primary outcome was AAA (AD >=30 mm) in Tromso 5 (2001). A secondary outcome was aortic growth of >5 mm over 7 years. Estimates of relative risk were calculated in logistic regression models. The main exposure variable was ASI. Adjustments were made for age, gender, smoking, body mass index, total and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and hypertension. Results. In total, 124 incident AAAs (20% among women) were detected. In adjusted analyses, both ASI and AD were strong predictors of AAA, with similar results for men and women. Both ASI and AD were also significant predictors of aortic growth >5 mm. In comparison, AD was superior to ASI as a predictor of both endpoints. Conclusions. ASI was a significant predictor of both AAA development and aortic growth of >5 mm for both men and women, but not a better predictor of either outcomes compared to the AD.

Objective(s): We aimed to describe the associations between serum sex steroids and early, screening-detected AAA in men. Method(s): We validated a high-sensitivity liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay for comprehensive serum sex hormone profiling. This assay was then employed in a case-control study including 147 men with AAA (infrarenal aorta>=30 mm) and 251 AAA-free controls recruited at the general population-based ultrasound screening for AAA in 65-year-old Swedish men. Outcomes included: associations between dehydroepiandrosterone, progesterone, 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, androstenedione, estrone, testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and estradiol and AAA presence. Result(s): Dehydroepiandrosterone, progesterone, 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, testosterone, and estradiol, but not the other hormones, were lower in men with AAA. In models with adjustments for known AAA risk factors and comorbidity, only progesterone (odds ratio per SD decrease 1.62 [95% CI, 1.18-2.22]) and estradiol (1.40 [95% CI, 1.04-1.87]) remained inversely associated with the presence of AAA. Progesterone and estradiol contributed with independent additive information for prediction of AAA presence; compared with men with high (above median) levels, men with low (below median) levels of both hormones had a 4-fold increased odds ratio for AAA (4.06 [95% CI, 2.25-7.31]). Conclusion(s): Measured by a high-performance sex steroid assay, progesterone and estradiol are inversely associated with AAA in men, independent of known risk factors.

The aim of this prospective study was to determine the predictive value of the abdominal aortic calcification index (ACI), a semi-quantitative measure of AAC, for CVEs in patients with ACS. We evaluated 314 patients with ACS. All patients underwent successful percutaneous coronary intervention to the culprit coronary vessel without in-hospital adverse events. ACI was calculated on non-contrast computed tomography images. CVEs were defined as a composite of cardiovascular death, ACS recurrence, and stroke. During a median follow-up period of 19.1 months, CVEs occurred in 29 patients (9.2%). Multivariable regression analysis after adjustment for age and gender showed a significantly higher baseline ACI in patients with CVEs than in those without [median (interquartile ranges), 42.1 (25.9-60.2) vs. 20.8 (8.8-38.6) %; P = 0.021]. The cutoff value of ACI for prediction of CVEs, estimated by receiver-operating characteristic analysis, was 29.2%, with sensitivity of 76% and specificity of 64% (area under the curve, 0.69). After adjustment for conventional cardiovascular risk factors, Cox analysis showed high ACI (>=29.2%) to be significantly associated with increased risk of CVEs (P = 0.011; hazard ratio, 1.82). Multivariate analysis identified high ACI as an independent predictor of CVEs (P = 0.012; hazard ratio, 1.80). Stepwise forward selection procedure also showed that high ACI was a significant independent determinant of CVEs (P = 0.004; R2, 0.089). Both net reclassification improvement (0.64; P = 0.001) and integrated discrimination improvement (0.04; P < 0.001) improved significantly after the addition of high ACI to conventional risk factors. Evaluation of ACI using CT seems to provide valuable clinical information for proper assessment of mid-term CVEs in patients with ACS after percutaneous coronary intervention.Copyright © 2019, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","Authors":"Oishi, H.; Horibe, H.; Yamase, Y.; Ueyama, C.; Takemoto, Y.; Shigeta, T.; Hibino, T.; Kondo, T.; Suzuki, S.; Ishii, H.; Murohara, T.","Publisher":"Heart and Vessels","Issue":"5","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00380-019-01527-6","Pages":"620-629","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"abdominal aortic calcification index (ACI)"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":18,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":2781,"Title":"GJA1 gene polymorphism is a genetic predictor of recurrence after pulmonary vein isolation in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation","Year":2022,"Country":"","Abstract":"Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) and recurrence of AF after pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) have been linked to sinus node dysfunction. Objective(s): The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between the heart rate-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in genome-wide association studies and recurrence of AF after PVI. Method(s): In this study, patients with paroxysmal AF who underwent initial PVI, including 522 patients for screening and 172 patients for replication, were recruited and 21 heart rate-associated SNPs identified in genome-wide association studies were genotyped. The association between these SNPs and the recurrence of AF was investigated. Result(s): Throughout the follow-up period of 21 +/- 12 months, 119 patients with paroxysmal AF (22.8%) exhibited AF recurrences in the screening set. The rate of AF recurrence was significantly associated with the minor allele C of the gap junction alpha-1 protein (GJA1) rs1015451 (additive model: odds ratio 2.07; P = 9.32 x 10-7), but not with other SNPs. This association was confirmed in the replication set (allelic model: odds ratio 1.81; P = 2.70 x 10-2). Multivariate analysis revealed that the recurrence of AF after AF ablation was independently related to the GJA1 SNP rs1015451 additive model, duration of AF >1 year, AF from non-pulmonary vein foci, and thicker interventricular septum. Conclusion(s): The GJA1 SNP rs1015451, coding for a gap junction protein (connexin-43), may be considered a novel genetic marker for AF recurrence after PVI.Copyright © 2022","Authors":"Okamura, S.; Ochi, H.; Onohara, Y.; Nakashima, M.; Akiyama, R.; Tokuyama, T.; Okubo, Y.; Ikeuchi, Y.; Miyauchi, S.; Miyamoto, S.; Oguri, N.; Uotani, Y.; Odake, Y.; Chayama, K.; Kihara, Y.; Nakano, Y.","Publisher":"Heart Rhythm","Issue":"12","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hrthm.2022.08.024","Pages":"2044-2050","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"GJA1 variant rs101545"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":24,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":2819,"Title":"Association Between Breast Arterial Calcification on Mammography and Coronary Artery Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","Year":2022,"Country":"","Abstract":"Background: Breast arterial calcification (BAC), which may be detected during screening mammography, is hypothesized to be a noninvasive imaging marker that may enhance cardiovascular risk assessment. Materials and Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we sought to assess the association between BAC and coronary artery disease (CAD) by conducting a meta-analysis. We conducted a literature search of PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane library, ClinicalTrials.gov, and conference proceedings, from inception through December 24, 2019. The outcome of interest was the presence of CAD in patients with BAC. This was reported as crude and adjusted odds ratio (OR). Results: A total of 18 studies comprising 33,494 women (mean age of 60.8 +/- 3.7 years, 25% with diabetes, 57% with hypertension, and 21% with history of tobacco smoking) were included in the current meta-analysis. The prevalence of BAC among study participants was 10%. There was a statistically significant association between BAC and CAD (unadjusted OR 2.14; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.63-2.81, p < 0.001, I2 = 76.5%). Moreover, adjusted estimates were available from 10 studies and BAC was an independent predictor of CAD (OR 2.39; 95% CI 1.68-3.41, p < 0.001, I2 = 61.7%). In the meta-regression analysis, covariates included year of publication, age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and history of tobacco smoking. None of these study covariates explained the heterogeneity across studies. Conclusions: BAC detected as part of screening mammography is a promising noninvasive imaging marker that may enhance CAD risk prediction in women. The clinical value of BAC for cardiovascular risk stratification merits further evaluation in large prospective studies.","Authors":"Osman, Mohammed; Regner, Sean; Osman, Khansa; Shahan, Cimmie; Kheiri, Babikir; Kadiyala, Madhavi; Sokos, George; Sengupta, Partho P.; Shapiro, Michael D.; Michos, Erin D.; Bianco, Christopher","Publisher":"Journal of women's health (2002)","Issue":"12","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/jwh.2020.8733","Pages":"1719-1726","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"breast arterial calcification (BAC)"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":2821,"Title":"Comparison of pentraxin-3 (PTX-3), and galectin-3 (GAL-3) with troponin I as biomarkers for early diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome","Year":2021,"Country":"","Abstract":"Background:Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) continues to be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Limited data on galectin-3 and pentraxin-3 are found as biomarkers in the ACS population. The objective of this study was to determine the variables that are most affected by high concentrations of pentraxin-3 (PTX-3) and galectin-3 (GAL-3), and the influence they have on outcomes of all-cause mortality in patients with ACS. Patients & Methods:One hundred and fifty patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) were included with 30 healthy subjects served as controls. Blood samples were drawn beforeprimary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and after 12 and 48 hours. Critical changes in Troponine I as well as in PTX-3, GAL-3, lipid profile, CRP, RBS and cardiac enzymes markers were examined. Result(s):Highly significant time dependent increase in serum PTX-3 and Gal-3 was observed among acute STEMI patients when compared to controls. Troponin I, PXT-3, and GAL-3 showed high sensitivity and specificity in the prediction of Acute STEMI. Sensitivities of Troponin I, PXT-3, and GAL-3 were 96%, 90% and 94% respectively, while specificities were 85%, 85% and 85% respectively. Moreover, significant increase in Troponin I, LDH, AST, CK-total, CK-MB, CRP, RBS and lipid profile were observed among the acute STEMI patients as compared to controls. Conclusion(s):We can conclude that both PTX-3 and GAL-3 could be excellent biomarkers of CVDACS. PTX-3 and GAL-3 plasma levels rise rapidly in acute myocardial infarction, reflecting the extent of tissue damage and predicting the risk of mortality.Copyright © 2021 Ubiquity Press.

PWPT was described as the time from the beginning of the P wave to its peak, and it was measured from leads DII and VI. The PAF diagnosis was confirmed if it was detected on the ECG during palpitation or in rhythm during the Holter recordings. Results In this study, 34 (37.7%) patients with acute IS were diagnosed with PAF. In multivariate analyses, the independent predictors of PAF were age, PWPT in lead VI and PWPT in lead DII (OR: 1.34, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.56; p<0.001).

The aim of the study is to assess the diagnostic and prognostic feasibility of FDG-PET/CT in comparison to cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) (alone or in combination) in patients with clinically suspected myocarditis undergoing EMB., METHODS: Fifty hospitalized patients with clinically suspected myocarditis who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled in a prospective, observational, multicentre, cohort study (NCT04085718). The primary endpoint is the sensitivity and specificity of FDG-PET/CT imaging in the diagnosis of myocarditis. The main secondary endpoints include correlation of FDG-PET/CT imaging with CMR, echocardiography, and EMB results. The patients will undergo the following evaluations: clinical examination, blood tests (including biomarkers of fibrosis and anti-heart autoantibodies (AHA)), ECG, 24 h Holter ECG, echocardiography, CMR, as well as resting single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to assess possible myocardial perfusion defects, cardiac FDG-PET/CT and right ventricular EMB. After 6-months a follow-up visit will be performed (including 24 h Holter ECG, echocardiography and CMR). Investigators evaluating individual studies (CMR, SPECT, FDG-PET/CT and EMB) are to be blinded to the other tests' results., CONCLUSION: We believe that FDG-PET/CT alone or in combination with CMR may be a useful tool for improving diagnostic accuracy in patients with clinically suspected myocarditis.

It has been proposed as an early biomarker for various diseases associated with ischemia. We aimed to investigate the relationship between serum IMA and peripheral artery disease (PAD) and whether it is a risk marker for the severity of PAD. Method(s): This prospective case-control study included 100 patients with lower extremity PAD and 50 volunteers without. Patients with resting pain, ulcer, and gangrene were excluded from the study. Patients with PAD included in the study were divided into two groups as mild claudication and moderate-severe claudication. Adjusted-IMA levels were calculated according to the median albumin values of the groups. The basic clinical features and laboratory findings of the participants were recorded and compared. Possible risk factors for presence and severity of PAD and IMA levels were examined by logistic regression and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses. Result(s): IMA and adjusted-IMA levels were significantly higher in the PAD group (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively). IMA and adjusted-IMA levels were significantly higher in PAD group 2, which had moderate-to-severe claudication and more pronounced ischemic symptoms (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively). Advanced age, presence of hypertension, smoking, low albumin levels, and high adjusted-IMA levels were independent predictors of PAD. There was a negative high correlation between adjusted-IMA levels and ABI (r: -0.666, p < 0.001, Spearman's correlation). ROC curve analysis demonstrated that adjusted-IMA cut-off values of 0.802 or above could predict presence and severity of peripheral artery disease with 70% sensitivity and 78% specificity (AUC: 0.825, 95% CI: 0.758-0.893, log rank p: 0.000). Conclusion(s): We determinated that increased adjusted-IMA levels were a predictors of the presence and severity of PAD.

In particular, we aimed to validate the use of NT-proBNP, and identify new blood biomarkers associated with AF. Also, we aimed to compare AF detection using various wearables and long-term Holter monitoring. Methods 359 subjects aged 65-75 years with hypertension and diabetes were included in two phases: Phase I (n = 100) and Phase II (n = 259). AF diagnosis was performed by baseline 12-lead ECG, 4 weeks of Holter monitoring (NuuboTM), and/or medical history. An aptamer array including 1310 proteins was measured in the blood of 26 patients. Candidates were selected according to p-value, logFC and biological function to be tested in verification and validation phases. Several screening devices were tested and compared: AliveCor, Watch BP, MyDiagnostick and Fibricheck. Results AF was present in 34 subjects (9.47%). The aptamer array revealed 41 proteins with differential expression in AF individuals. TIMP-2 and ST-2 were the most promising candidates in the verification analysis, but none of them was further validated. NT-proBNP (log-transformed) (OR = 1.934; p<0.001) was the only independent biomarker to detect AF in the whole cohort. Compared to an ECG, WatchBP had the highest sensitivity (84.6%) and AUC (0.895 [0.780-1]), while MyDiagnostick showed the highest specificity (97.10%). Conclusion The inclusion and monitoring of a cohort of primary care patients for AF detection, together with the testing of biomarkers and screening devices provided useful lessons about AF screening in our community. An AF screening strategy using rhythm detection devices and short monitoring periods among high-risk patients with high NT-proBNP levels could be feasible.Copyright © 2022 Pala et al.

Novel biomarkers are needed to identify NSTEMI in AMI patients. The study objective was to use proteomics to identify novel plasma biomarkers for STEMI and NSTEMI patients. iTRAQ analysis was performed on pooled samples from 8 healthy controls and 12 STEMI and 12 NSTEMI patients. Bioinformatics analysis identified 95 differentially expressed proteins that were differentially expressed in the plasma of AMI patients and healthy controls; 28 of these proteins were found in STEMI/Con (22 upregulated and 6 downregulated), 48 in NSTEMI/Con (12 upregulated and 36 downregulated), and 44 in NSTEMI/STEMI (11 upregulated and 33 downregulated). Protein network analysis was then performed using STRING software. Functional analysis revealed that the identified plasma proteins were mainly involved with carbon metabolism, toll-like receptor signaling pathway, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Nine of the proteins (SSA1, MDH1, FCN2, GPI, S100A8, LBP, vinculin, VDBP, and RBP4) that changed levels during AMI progression were further validated by ELISA. The constructed plasma proteome could reflect the AMI pathogenesis molecular mechanisms and provide a method for the early identification of NSTEMI in AMI patients. Significance: The aim of this study was to use proteomics to identify novel predictive plasma biomarkers for patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), which would allow for either identification of individuals at risk of an infarction, and early identification of NSTEMI in patients with AMI. Using an approach that combined iTRAQ with LC-MS/MS, we found 95 proteins that showed significant differences in expression levels among the AMI patients and healthy controls. The proteins SSA1, MDH1, FCN2, GPI, S100A8, LBP, vinculin, VDBP, and RBP4 were found to play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of AMI. Using bioinformatics analysis, we found that dysregulation of carbon metabolism, toll-like receptor signaling pathway, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may be the major driving forces for cardiac damage during myocardial infarction. However, further investigations are needed to verify the mechanisms involved in the development of AMI especially NSTEMI. Taken together, our findings lay the foundation for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenic processes of AMI, and suggest potential applications for specific biomarkers in early diagnosis and determination of prognosis.Copyright © 2020 The Authors","Authors":"Pan, Y.; Wang, L.; Xie, Y.; Tan, Y.; Chang, C.; Qiu, X.; Li, X.","Publisher":"Journal of Proteomics","Issue":"Not Available","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2020.103923","Pages":"103923","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"95 differentially expressed proteins & of these 9 were very important"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":3,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":25,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":2907,"Title":"Optimizing the Recognition and Treatment of In-Hospital Stroke: Evaluation of the 2CAN Score","Year":2021,"Country":"","Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Stroke-like symptoms may be difficult to appreciate due to the high incidence of stroke mimics (e.g., delirium) in the inpatient population. Many centers have adopted inpatient-specific stroke protocols with the aim of improving time to diagnosis and treatment. We aimed to assess one of these instruments, the \"2CAN\" score, in our patient population., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted for all inpatients for whom our Brain Attack Team (BAT) was called between January 2015 and June 2019.

Twenty percent of patients had a history of atrial fibrillation, 72% hypertension, and 36% diabetes. Median NIHSS was 14.5 (IQR 5-24). Only 18% of stroke calls occurred within 24 h of hospital admission. The mean 2CAN score was 2.8. Ninety-seven (88%) patients received a final diagnosis of ischemic stroke and 13 (12%) of stroke mimics. There was no difference between 2CAN scores in the stroke and mimic groups (P = 0.91). A 2CAN score of >= 2 had sensitivity 83.5%, specificity 23.1%, PPV 89.0%, and NPV 15.8% for stroke., CONCLUSIONS: The 2CAN score was derived and validated in a single academic center as a tool to recognize inpatient stroke. The 2CAN score had good sensitivity and positive predictive value for stroke in our cohort, but poor specificity. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

The prospective associations of impairment in cardiac mechanical function, as assessed by speckle-tracking echocardiography, with incident AF are less clear., METHODS: In the Cardiovascular Health Study, a community-based cohort of older adults, participants free of AF with echocardiograms of adequate quality for speckle tracking were included. We evaluated the associations of indices of cardiac mechanics (LA reservoir strain, LV longitudinal strain, and LV early diastolic strain rate) with incident AF., RESULTS: Of 4341 participants with strain imaging, participants with lower LA reservoir strain were older, had more cardiometabolic risk factors, and had lower renal function at baseline. Over a median follow-up of 10 years, 497 (11.4%) participants developed AF. Compared with the highest quartile of LA reservoir strain, the lowest quartile of LA reservoir strain was associated with higher risk of AF after covariate adjustment, including LA volume and LV longitudinal strain (heart rate [HR], 1.80; 95% CI, 1.31-2.45; P < 0.001). The association of LA reservoir strain and AF was stronger in subgroups with higher blood pressure, NT-proBNP, and LA volumes. There were no associations of LV longitudinal strain and LV early diastolic strain rate with incident AF after adjustment for LA reservoir strain., CONCLUSION: Lower LA reservoir strain was associated with incident AF, independent of LV mechanics, and with stronger associations in high-risk subgroups. These findings suggest that LA mechanical dysfunction precedes the development of AF.

Prolidase is a key enzyme in collagen synthesis; a decrease in prolidase activity or level may decrease collagen biosynthesis, which may contribute to ectasia formation. Considering that, the variations in PEPD gene encoding prolidase enzyme were evaluated by analyzing next-generation sequencing (NGS) for the first time together with known risk factors in coronary artery ectasia (CAE) patients., METHODS: Molecular analysis of the PEPD gene was performed on genomic DNA by NGS in 76 CAE patients and 76 controls. The serum levels of prolidase were measured by the sandwich-ELISA technique., RESULTS: Serum prolidase levels were significantly lower in CAE group compared to control group, and it was significantly lower in males than females in both groups (p < 0.001). On the other hand, elevated prolidase levels were observed in CAE patients in the presence of diabetes (p < 0.001), hypertension (p < 0.05) and hyperlipidemia (p < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the low prolidase level (p < 0.001), hypertension (p < 0.02) and hyperlipidemia (p < 0.012) were significantly associated with increased CAE risk. We identified four missense mutations in the PEPD gene, namely G296S, T266A, P365L and S134C (novel) that could be associated with CAE. The pathogenicity of these mutations was predicted to be \"damaging\" for G296S, S134C and P365L, but \"benign\" for T266A. We also identified a novel 5'UTR variation (Chr19:34012748 G>A) in one patient who had a low prolidase level. In addition, rs17570 and rs1061338 common variations of the PEPD gene were associated with low prolidase levels in CAE patients, while rs17569 variation was associated with high prolidase levels in both CAE and controls (p < 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the low serum prolidase levels observed in CAE patients is significantly associated with PEPD gene variations. It was concluded that low serum prolidase level and associated PEPD mutations may be potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of CAE. Copyright © 2022.

Furthermore, estimations regarding persisting impairments after MIS are essential to guide rehabilitation programs. This study evaluated a combined clinical- and serum biomarker-based approach for the differentiation between TIA and MIS as well as the mid-term prognostication of the functional outcome, which is applicable within the first 24 h after symptom onset. Method(s): Prospectively collected data were used for a retrospective analysis including the neurological deficit at admission (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, NIHSS) and the following serum biomarkers covering different pathophysiological aspects of stroke: Coagulation (fibrinogen, antithrombin), inflammation (C reactive protein), neuronal damage in the cellular [neuron specific enolase], and the extracellular compartment [matrix metalloproteinase-9, hyaluronic acid]. Further, cerebral magnetic resonance imaging was performed at baseline and day 7, while functional outcome was evaluated with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) after 3, 6, and 12 months. Result(s): Based on data from 96 patients (age 64 +/- 14 years), 23 TIA patients (NIHSS 0.6 +/- 1.1) were compared with 73 MIS patients (NIHSS 2.4 +/- 2.0). In a binary logistic regression analysis, the combination of NIHSS and serum biomarkers differentiated MIS from TIA with a sensitivity of 91.8% and a specificity of 60.9% [area under the curve (AUC) 0.84]. In patients with NIHSS 0 at admission, this panel resulted in a still acceptable sensitivity of 81.3% (specificity 71.4%, AUC 0.69) for the differentiation between MIS (n = 16) and TIA (n = 14). By adding age, remarkable sensitivities of 98.4, 100, and 98.2% for the prediction of an excellent outcome (mRS 0 or 1) were achieved with respect to time points investigated within the 1-year follow-up. However, the specificity was moderate and decreased over time (83.3, 70, 58.3%; AUC 0.96, 0.92, 0.91). Conclusion(s): This pilot study provides evidence that the NIHSS combined with selected serum biomarkers covering pathophysiological aspects of stroke may represent a useful tool to differentiate between MIS and TIA within 24 h after symptom onset. Further, this approach may accurately predict the mid-term outcome in minor stroke patients, which might help to allocate rehabilitative resources.© Copyright © 2021 Pelz, Kubitz, Kamprad-Lachmann, Harms, Federbusch, Hobohm and Michalski.","Authors":"Pelz, J.

The aim of this study was to identify clinical, imaging or laboratory markers which can predict significant CAD among patients with an AF episode and chest pain. Methods We included 57 consecutive patients admitted to our hospital with AF and chest pain. All patients underwent coronary evaluation. Significant CAD was defined as >50% stenosis in a major coronary artery by coronary angiography or cardiac CT. We compared CAD and non-CAD groups and analyzed risk factorsby regression analysis. Results Twenty-four patients (42%) were diagnosed with- and 33 patients (58%) without obstructive CAD. In a multivariate analysis of regional wall motion abnormality (RWMA), elevated troponin and hypertension were found to be predictors for CAD [odds ratio (OR), 22.4 (confidence interval (CI), 1.8-272.4; P = 0.02); OR, 5.6 (CI, 1-31.0; P = 0.05) and OR, 21.4 (CI, 1.6-284.6; P = 0.02), respectively].

Conclusion In patients who present acutely with chest pain and AF, troponin elevation and RWMA appear to be highly predictive of obstructive CAD, whereas clinical symptoms and ECG changes are not predictive. These findings may be helpful for guiding the management of patients admitted with AF and chest pain.Copyright © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Enhanced CyPA platelet surface expression is associated with hypertension and hypercholesterolemia in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD). In patients with acute myocardial infarction CyPA platelet surface expression is significantly decreased. The aim of this study was to investigate possible associations of CyPA platelet surface expression and a clinically relevant CyPA single-nucleotide polymorphism (CyPA PPIA rs6850) with prognosis in patients with symptomatic cardiovascular disease. Material(s) and Method(s): Blood was obtained from 335 consecutive patients with symptomatic CAD. All patients were followed up for 1080 days for endpoints all-cause death, myocardial infarction (MI), ischemic stroke, and bleeding. The primary combined endpoint was defined as a composite of all-cause death and/or MI and/or ischemic stroke. Cyclophilin A platelet surface expression levels less than or equal to the median were significantly associated with a worse prognosis (combined endpoint and all-cause death) when compared to CyPA greater than the median. Genotyping for CyPA PPIA rs6850 was performed in 752 patients with symptomatic CAD. Homozygous carriers of the minor allele showed a significantly worse cumulative event-free survival for both combined endpoint and MI when compared to carriers of the major allele. Conclusion(s): The CyPA platelet surface expression is associated with mortality whereas CyPA PPIA rs6850 is associated with recurrent MI in patients with symptomatic CAD.

The H19 gene plays a functional role in increasing the prevalence of IS risk factors. We evaluated the correlation between H19 rs217727 polymorphism and the expression level of H19 lncRNA with susceptibility to IS among the Iranian population. Method(s): Blood samples were collected from IS patients (n = 114) and controls (n = 114). We concentrated on the expression pattern of H19 at different time points (i.e., 0-24, 24-48, and 48-72 h after stroke). The tetra-amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction (T-ARMS-PCR) method was applied for DNA genotyping. We used the quantitative real-time PCR to evaluate H19 expression levels. We used the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to evaluate the diagnosis and prognosis of IS. Result(s): The rs217727polymorphism of H19 was related with IS susceptibility in the co-dominant (OR = 2.92, 95% CI = 0.91-10.92, P = 0.04) and recessive models (OR = 2.80, 95% CI = 0.96-8.15, P = 0.04). H19 expression was significantly upregulated in IS and remained high for 72 h after stroke. ROC curves showed that H19 expression within the first 24 h from stroke onset might serve as a biomarker for the early diagnosis of IS with 79.49% sensitivity and 80.00% specificity. H19 expression in small vessel occlusion (SVO) and large-artery atherosclerosis (LAA) patients were 3.74 and 3.34 times higher than the undetermined (UD) subtype, respectively [OR = 3.74 95% CL (1.14-12.27) P = 0.030 and OR = 3.34 95% CL (1.13-9.85) P = 0.029]. Conclusion(s): The rs217727 polymorphism of the H19 is correlated with IS susceptibility, and H19 expression levels were higher in SVO and LAA patients. The upregulation of H19 may be considered as a diagnostic biomarker in IS among the Iranian population, but it cannot serve as a useful prognostic marker.Copyright © 2021, BioMed Central Ltd.

We compared safety, effectiveness and 12-month incidence of the composite endpoint of all-cause death and myocardial infarction between (i) a single-sampling, dual-marker pathway combining high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) and ultra-sensitive copeptin (us-Cop) at presentation (hs-cTnI <= 27 ng/L, us-Cop < 10 pmol/L and low-risk ECG) and (ii) a single-sampling pathway based on one-off hs-cTnI determination at presentation (hs-cTnI < 5 ng/L and low-risk ECG). As a comparator, we used the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 0/1-h dual-sampling algorithm. Result(s): We enrolled 1,136 patients (male gender 65%) with median age of 64 years (interquartile range, 51-75). Overall, 228 (20%) patients received a final diagnosis of AMI. The two single-sampling instant rule-out pathways yielded similar negative predictive value (NPV): 97.4% (95%CI: 95.4-98.7) and 98.7% (95%CI: 96.9-99.6) for dual-marker and single hs-cTnI algorithms, respectively (P = 0.11). Both strategies were comparably safe as the ESC 0/1-h dual-sampling algorithm and this was consistent across subgroups of early-comers, low-intermediate risk (GRACE-score < 140) and renal dysfunction. Despite a numerically higher rate of false-negative results, the dual-marker strategy ruled-out a slightly but significantly higher percentage of patients compared with single hs-cTnI determination (37.4% versus 32.9%; P < 0.001). There were no significant between-group differences in 12-month composite outcome. Conclusion(s): Instant rule-out pathways based on one-off determination of hs-cTnI alone or in combination with us-Cop are comparably safe as the ESC 0/1 h algorithm for the instant rule-out of AMI, yielding similar prognostic information. Instant rule-out strategies are safe alternatives to the ESC 0/1 h algorithm and allow the rapid and effective triage of suspected AMI in patients with low-risk ECG. However, adding copeptin to hs-cTn does not improve the safety of instant rule-out compared with the single rule-out hs-cTn at very low cut-off concentrations.Copyright © 2022 Ricci, Neumann, Rubsamen, Sorensen, Ojeda, Cataldo, Zeller, Schafer, Hartikainen, Golato, Palermi, Zimarino, Blankenberg, Westermann and De Caterina.","Authors":"Ricci, F.; Neumann, J.

We investigated the relation of circulating serum HSP70 (sHSP70) with inflammatory cytokines and recurrence of symptomatic recent onset AF (ROAF). We enrolled 90 patients with ROAF (the duration from onset of symptoms <=24 hours) and 30 controls. Patients received amiodarone for cardioversion and rhythm control. The association of serum HSP70, serum interleukin-2 (sIL-2), and serum interleukin-4 (sIL-4) with the presence of cardioversion and AF recurrence within a year was investigated. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling dependence for IL-2 and IL-4 induction in response to stimulation with HSP70 was tested in rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cell cultures. Patients had higher sHSP70 and sIL-2 and lower sIL-4 compared with controls. Serum HSP70 was independently associated with ROAF (P = 0.005) and correlated with sIL-2 (r = 0.494, P < 0.001) and sIL-4 (r = -0.550, P < 0.001). By 48 hours, 71 of the 90 patients were cardioverted, with noncardioverted patients having higher sHSP70 and sIL-2 and lower sIL-4, which were the only independent factors associated with cardioversion. AF recurred in 38 of the 71 cardioverted patients in 1 year. A cutoff value of sHSP70 >=0.65 ng/mL and sIL-2 >=0.21 pg/mL was the only independent factor associated with AF recurrence (hazard ratio: 3.311, 95% confidence interval: 1.503-7.293, P = 0.003 and hazard ratio: 3.144, 95% confidence interval: 1.341-7.374, P = 0.008, respectively). The exposure of smooth muscle cell to HSP70 in vitro increased the expression of IL-2 (5x) and IL-4 (1.5x) through TLR4-dependent and receptor-independent mechanisms. In conclusion, sHSP70 and sIL-2 might constitute a prognostic tool for determining the cardioversion and recurrence likelihood in ROAF. Copyright © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The limited reliability to predict the risk of stroke after a transient ischemic attack (TIA) justifies the objective of our study to determine the role of NT-pro-BNP in patients with TIAs., METHODS: From our prospective stroke registry, we performed a retrospective study in all patients with the diagnosis of TIA admitted to the Stroke Unit of our Hospital between January 2008 and March 2018. NT-pro-BNP was determined in the first hours after TIA. The endpoint was the development of stroke during the follow-up., RESULTS: 381 patients were included. Mean time of follow-up was 36.8 (+/-16.4) months. 224 patients were hospitalized due to a stroke during the follow-up, and 157 were not. NT-pro-BNP serum levels were higher in patients who suffered a stroke compared to those who did not (p<<0.001). We also found greater levels of this marker the earlier the stroke happened (p=0.024). A cut-off point of 800pg/mL of NT-pro-BNP predicted a stroke with a sensitivity of 64% and a specificity of 79% (p<<0.001), and was independently associated with higher risk of stroke after a TIA (OR: 6.65, p<<0.001). This association persisted for different etiopathogenic TIA groups (cardioembolic: OR 26.12, p<<0.001; undetermined: OR 4.87, p=0.006; atherothrombotic: OR 1.67, p=0.044)., CONCLUSIONS: The early determination of NT-pro-BNP is a simple and very useful alternative to predict the prognosis after TIA regardless of the etiopathogenesis of the TIA.

Retrospective analysis of standard ABPI and handheld Doppler waveform characteristics (n = 200). Prospective analysis of angle-corrected Doppler acceleration index (AccI, n = 148) and standard ABPI with testing of performance to diagnose PAD as assessed with imaging reference standards in consecutive patients. The highest AccI from handheld Doppler at ankle arteries was significantly logarithmically associated with the highest standard ABPI (E[y] = 0.32 ln [1.71 * x + 1], p < 0.001, R2 = 0.68, n = 100 limbs).

We aimed to analyze the predictors of asymptomatic angiographically significant CAD detected by simultaneous cerebral and coronary angiography. Method(s): This retrospective cohort study screened data obtained between August 2009 and April 2019; 11,047 patients underwent cerebral angiography for atherosclerotic change (>50% stenosis or aneurysm) seen in brain magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or computed tomography angiography (CTA) at a single center by endovascular neurosurgeon's decision. Of these, 700 patients including 622 patients who underwent simultaneous coronary and cerebral angiography and 78 patients who underwent coronary angiography within a month were enrolled. We investigated the characteristics and predictors of angiographically significant CAD (>50% stenosis). Furthermore, we also analyzed the major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE), including all-cause death, myocardial infarction, and stroke for 5 years. Result(s): The frequency of significant CAD was 59% (413/700), the mean age was 68.9 +/- 10.3 years, and 60.6% were male. During mean follow-up of 50 months, the MACCE rate of our whole cohort was significantly higher in the CAD group (21.5%) than in the non-CAD group (14.6%; hazard ratio 1.65, 95% CI 1.17-2.33, p value = 0.005). Considering that the embolic stroke is less associated with atherosclerotic change, our predictive model of significant CAD was made without embolic stroke (n = 599). In our multivariate model 2 including univariate <0.1, the independent predictors of significant CAD were male (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.11-2.35, p = 0.012), diabetes mellitus (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.22-2.68, p = 0.003), previous stroke (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.02-2.60, p = 0.039), low ankle-brachial index (ABI; <0.9; OR 3.25, 95% CI 1.21-8.73, p = 0.019), left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) <50% on echocardiography (OR 2.82, 95% CI 1.25-6.35, p = 0.012), troponin I or T positive (OR 2.76, 95% CI 1.69-4.53, p < 0.001), and complex features on cerebral angiography (OR 2.73, 95% CI 1.78-4.19, p < 0.001).

Quantitative fQRS (Q-fQRS) was defined as the total amount of deflections in the QRS complex in all 12 electrocardiography (ECG) leads. Q-fQRS was scored by a single observer and reproducibility was determined by three independent observers. Q-fQRS count was feasible with acceptable intra-and inter-observer agreement. Q-fQRS count is significantly higher in patients with definite ACM (54 +/- 15) and pathogenic variant carriers (55 +/- 10) compared to controls (35 +/- 5) (p < 0.001).

To find molecular markers for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), this research further verified the relationship between the expression level of FFAR2 gene and AMI by expanding the sample size based on the previous gene chip results. Methods. Peripheral venous leukocytes were collected from 113 patients with AMI and 94 patients with noncoronary artery disease as the experimental group and the control group, respectively. Real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the expression of the FFAR2 gene. Western blot analysis was applied to detect the relative expression of the FFAR2 gene at the level of protein. Furthermore, the relationship between gene expression and clinical data was also analyzed and compared. Results. The level of expression of FFAR2 gene in peripheral blood of patients with AMI was significantly lower than that of the control group (0.33 [0.04-1.08], 0.62 [0.07-1.86], respectively; p<0.05), which was 0.53 times that of the control group. Western blot results presented that the FFAR2 protein level in the peripheral blood of the AMI group was lower than that of the control group (0.114; p=0.004). Analyzing clinical data of the subjects indicated that the average age of the AMI group was significantly higher than the age of control group (p<0.01). Also, the fasting blood glucose level was higher (p<0.01), and the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level was lower (p=0.03). The FFAR2 mRNA level correlated positively with the HDL-C level (p<0.01). Logistic regression analysis suggested that the low expression of the FFAR2 gene in peripheral blood may be a risk factor for AMI independent of age, family history of diabetes, fasting blood glucose level, and HDL-C level (p=0.025). Compared with the high FFAR2 expression group, the risk of AMI in the low FFAR2 expression group was 6.308 times higher. Conclusion. The expression level of the FFAR2 gene in peripheral blood of patients with AMI was significantly lower than that in the control group. Low expression of the FFAR2 gene in peripheral blood is an independent risk factor for AMI. Hence, it may also be a potential biomarker to predict AMI.Copyright © 2020 Jianjun Ruan et al.","Authors":"Ruan, J.; Meng, H.; Wang, X.; Chen, W.; Tian, X.; Meng, F.","Publisher":"Cardiology Research and Practice","Issue":"Not Available","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2020/3108124","Pages":"3108124","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"FFAR2 gene expression"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":18,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":3209,"Title":"Impact of Baseline Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate Using CKD-EPI Equation on Long-term Prognosis of STEMI Patients: A Matter of Small Increments!","Year":2022,"Country":"","Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Baseline biomarkers including glomerular filtration rate (GFR) guide the management of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

Subjects with more than 30% stenosis in at least one coronary artery, patients with a history of prior percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary by-pass surgery were allocated to the patient group; whereas the subjects without at least 30% stenosis consisted the control group. Groups were similar in age, presence of hypertension, and smoking status. However, the proportion of males and subjects taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, beta blockers, nitrates, and statins were higher in the patient group. miR-221 and miR-155 were downregulated (P = .02 and .001, respectively), while miR-21 levels were significantly increased (P = .003) in the patient group compared to controls.

We propose a simple and cheap ECG based score to predict AF development., METHODS: A cohort of 16 316 patients was analysed. ECG measures provided by the computer-assisted ECG software were used to identify patients. A first group included patients in sinus rhythm who showed an ECG with AF at any time later (n=505). A second group included patients with all their ECGs in sinus rhythm (n=15 811). By using a training set (75% of the cohort) the initial sinus rhythm ECGs of both groups were analysed and a predictive risk score based on a multivariate logistic model was constructed., RESULTS: A multivariate regression model was constructed with 32 variables showing a predictive value characterised by an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.776 (95% CI: 0.738 to 0.814). The subsequent risk score included the following variables: age, duration of P-wave in aVF, V4 and V5; duration of T-wave in V3, mean QT interval adjusted for heart rate, transverse P-wave clockwise rotation, transverse P-wave terminal angle and transverse QRS complex terminal vector magnitude. Risk score values ranged from 0 (no risk) to 5 (high risk). The predictive validity of the score reached an AUC of 0.764 (95% CI: 0.722 to 0.806) with a global specificity of 61% and a sensitivity of 55%., CONCLUSIONS: The automatic assessment of ECG biomarkers from ECGs in sinus rhythm is able to predict the risk for AF providing a low-cost screening strategy for early detection of this pathology.

A pre-established voice biomarker was derived from each individual recording, and the mean biomarker value was calculated for each patient. Individuals were clinically observed through December 31, 2019. The prespecified primary outcome was a composite of presenting to the emergency department with chest pain, being admitted to the hospital with chest pain, or having an acute coronary syndrome; the prespecified secondary outcome was a composite of a positive stress test result at follow-up or the presence of CAD at follow-up coronary angiography., RESULTS: In the final analysis, 108 patients were included (mean age, 59.47+/-11.44 years; male, 59 [54.6%]).

The authors investigated the value of the analysis of high-frequency QRS components as a marker of abnormal depolarization in addition to standard ST-deviations as a marker of abnormal repolarization to improve the diagnostic accuracy., METHODS AND RESULTS: Consecutive patients undergoing bicycle exercise stress nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging were prospectively enrolled. Presence of myocardial ischaemia, the primary diagnostic endpoint, was adjudicated using MPI and coronary angiography. Automated high-frequency QRS analysis was performed in a blinded fashion. The prognostic endpoint was major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) during two years of follow-up. Exercise-induced ischaemia was detected in 147/662 patients (22%). The sensitivity of high-frequency QRS was similar to ST-deviations (46% vs. 43%, p=0.59), while the specificity was lower (75% vs. 87%, p<0.001). The combined use of high-frequency QRS and ST-deviations classified 59% of patients as 'rule-out' (both negative), 9% as 'rule-in' (both positive) and 32% in an intermediate zone (one test positive). The sensitivity for 'rule-out' and the specificity for 'rule-in' improved to 63% and 97% compared with ST-deviation analysis alone (both p<0.001). MACE-free survival was 90%, 80% and 42% in patients in the 'rule-out', intermediate and 'rule-in' groups (p<0.001).

At the population level, even when limited to TTNtvs in cardiac-specific exons (hiPSI TTNtvs) penetrance estimates for DCM are low. Recent work shows that individuals harboring TTNtvs have a high prevalence of other cardiac conditions aside from heart failure, in particular, atrial fibrillation (Afib). Objective(s): Pinpoint the genetic footprint TTN-related diagnoses aside from DCM, such as Afib, and determine if vetting additional significantly-associated phenotypes better stratifies cardiomyopathy risk across TTN carriers. Method(s): We leverage longitudinal EHR and exome sequencing data from two cohorts to determine the penetrance of TTNtvs using multiple gene expression models against Afib, CM, and other cardiac diagnoses. Result(s): Controlling for CM and Afib, related cardio phenotypes retain only nominal association with TTNtvs. An unbiased sliding window analysis of TTNtvs across the locus confirms the association is specific to hiPSI exons for both CM and Afib, with no meaningful associations in lowPSI exons nor improvements from LOFTEE designations. We find 34% of hiPSI TTNtv carriers with early Afib have a CM diagnosis - a 5-fold increase in risk over non-carriers with early Afib and 47-fold increase over population controls. Conclusion(s): CM and Afib are often coincident in hiPSI TTNtv carriers, which represent varying and progressive manifestations of structurally-based heart failure. We provide statistical support for a hiPSI variant interpretation model for TTNtvs and evidence for the first population-level screening method with clinical utility for cardiomyopathies, especially in relation to an Afib finding.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

In clinical studies, elevated TML levels predicted major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with acute or stable coronary artery disease (CAD). In contrast to cardiovascular patients, the role of TML in patients with acute cerebral ischemia is unknown. Here, we evaluated circulating TML levels in 374 stroke patients from the prospective biomarkers in stroke (MARK-STROKE) study. Compared with 167 matched healthy controls, acute ischemic stroke patients had lower median TML plasma concentrations, i.e. 0.71 vs. 0.47 micromol/L (p < 0.001) and this difference persisted after adjusting for age and sex. TML plasma concentrations were associated with age, serum creatinine, glucose, cholesterol and lysine. Patients with prevalent arterial hypertension, atrial fibrillation or a history of myocardial infarction had increased TML levels, but this observation was not independent of age, sex and GFR. In 274 patients, follow-up data were available. During a median follow-up of 284 [25th-75th percentile: 198, 431] days, TML was not associated with incident MACE (stroke, myocardial infarction, death).

Primary outcomes were CE stroke etiology and NDAF after prolonged cardiac monitoring, as well as a composite outcome of MACE (recurrent cerebrovascular events, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular death) within 1 year. Logistic/Poisson and subproportional hazard regression were applied to evaluate the association between MR-proANP levels and outcomes.

We examined the association of baseline growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15), a marker of inflammation and cellular injury, with cardiovascular events, hospitalization for heart failure (HF), and kidney outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes in the CANVAS (Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study) and determined the effect of the sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor canagliflozin on circulating GDF-15. Methods and Results The CANVAS trial randomized 4330 people with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk to canagliflozin or placebo. The association between baseline GDF-15 and cardiovascular (non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, cardiovascular death), HF, and kidney (40% estimated glomerular filtration rate decline, end-stage kidney disease, renal death) outcomes was assessed using multivariable adjusted Cox regression models. During median follow-up of 6.1 years (N=3549 participants with available samples), 555 cardiovascular, 129 HF, and 137 kidney outcomes occurred. Each doubling in baseline GDF-15 was significantly associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular (hazard ratio [HR], 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0-1.3), HF (HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-2.0) and kidney (HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-2.0) outcomes. Baseline GDF-15 did not modify canagliflozin's effect on cardiovascular, HF, and kidney outcomes.

Conclusions In patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk, higher GDF-15 levels were associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular, HF, and kidney outcomes. Canagliflozin modestly lowered GDF-15, but GDF-15 reduction did not mediate the protective effect of canagliflozin.","Authors":"Sen, Taha; Li, Jingwei; Neuen, Brendon L.; Arnott, Clare; Neal, Bruce; Perkovic, Vlado; Mahaffey, Kenneth W.; Shaw, Wayne; Canovatchel, William; Hansen, Michael K.; Heerspink, Hiddo J.

Genetic predisposition to endothelial dysfunction has been associated with IHD and its clinical manifestation. However, studies are often confounding and inconclusive for several rea-sons, such as interethnic differences. Validation of results in larger cohorts and new populations is needed. The aim of this study is to evaluate the associations between the allelic variants of the eNOS rs1799983 single-nucleotide polymorphism, IHD susceptibility and its clinical presentation. Meth-ods: A total of 362 consecutive patients with suspected myocardial ischemia were enrolled. Patients were divided into three groups: G1, coronary artery disease (CAD); G2, coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD); and G3, a control group with anatomically and functionally normal coronary arteries. Analysis of three allelic variants, GT, GG and TT, of rs1799983 for the NOS3 gene, encoding for eNOS, was performed. Result(s): rs1799983_GT was significantly more expressed by the ischemic groups (G1 and G2) compared to G3. The TT variant was significantly more expressed by the G1 group, compared to the G2 group. Among ischemic patients, GT was significantly more expressed in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) presentation, compared to other clinical presenta-tions. In the multivariate analysis, the allelic variant GT was found to potentially represent an independent predictor of IHD and ACS presentation. Conclusion(s): The presence of the SNP rs1799983_GT, encoding for eNOS, is an independent risk factor for IHD and, remarkably, for ACS presentation, independently of cardiovascular risk factors. These results may be useful for the prediction of IHD development, particularly with an acute clinical manifestation. They may allow the early identification of patients at high risk of developing IHD with an ACS, promoting a genetic-based prevention strategy against IHD.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

The current approach uses a combinatorial head-impulse, nystagmus, and test-of-skew method and is sensitive enough to differentiate central causes from peripheral ones. However, it is difficult to perform and underused. Further, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is not always available and can have low sensitivity for detecting posterior circulation strokes., OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the feasibility and utility of the bucket test (BT), which measures the difference between patient's subjective perception of the visual vertical and the true vertical, as a screening tool for stroke in patients presenting to the ED with acute dizziness., METHODS: In this work, we prospectively enrolled 81 patients that presented to our academic medical center ED with dizziness as their chief complaint. The BT was performed 3 times for every patient., RESULTS: Seventy-one patients met the study criteria and were included in the analysis. Ten patients were excluded because of a history of drug-seeking behavior. There were no reported difficulties performing the BT. Six patients (8%) were diagnosed with ischemic stroke on MRI and 1 additional patient was diagnosed with transient ischemic attack and found to have a stroke on subsequent MRI. All 7 patients with dizziness attributed to cerebrovascular etiology had an abnormal BT, resulting in a sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI] 59-100%). The specificity of the BT was 38% (95% CI 24-52%). The positive predictive value of the BT for detecting stroke was 18% (95% CI 15-21%)., CONCLUSIONS: The BT is an easy, cheap, safe, and quick test that is feasible and sensitive to screen acutely dizzy patients for stroke in the ED.

The evaluation of newly recognized LBBB includes screening for structural heart abnormalities and coronary artery disease (CAD). In patients whose LV ejection fraction (EF) is preserved during initial testing, the incidence of subsequent cardiomyopathy is not firmly established. Hypothesis: The risk of developing LV systolic dysfunction among LBBB patients with preserved LVEF is high enough to warrant serial imaging. Method(s): We screened records of 1000 consecutive patients with LBBB from our ECG database and identified subjects with an initially preserved LVEF (>=45%) without clinically relevant CAD or other cause for cardiomyopathy. Baseline imaging, clinical data, and follow-up imaging were recorded to determine the risk of subsequent LV systolic dysfunction (LVEF <=40%). Result(s): (Data are mean + SD) 784 subjects were excluded, the majority for CAD or depressed LVEF upon initial imaging. Of the remaining 216, 37 (17%) developed a decline in LVEF(<=40%) over a mean follow-up of 55 +/- 31 months; 94% of these patients had a baseline LVEF<=60% and LV end systolic diameter (ESD) >= 2.9 cm indicating that these measures may be useful to define which patients warrant longitudinal follow-up. The negative predictive value of a LVEF>60% and LVESD <2.9 cm was 98%. Conclusion(s): Seventeen percent of patients with LBBB and initial preserved LVEF develop dyssynchrony cardiomyopathy. We believe the risk of developing dyssynchrony cardiomyopathy is high enough to warrant serial assessment of LV systolic function in this high-risk population.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

However, the difference between culprit and nonculprit lesions is unclear, as are the factors associated with favorable treatment outcomes. Purpose(s): To quantify characteristics of intracranial atherosclerosis with mild luminal stenosis and to identify factors associated with lesion type (culprit or nonculprit) and with clinical outcomes. Study Type: Prospective. Population: 293 patients who had acute stroke with mild luminal stenosis (<50%) in the middle cerebral or basilar artery. Field Strength/Sequence: 3.0 T higher resolution magnetic resonance imaging (hrMRI) of intracranial arteries and whole brain MR images. Assessment: Morphological and compositional analysis of plaques was performed. This included assessment of plaque volume, plaque burden, remodeling ratio, eccentricity, intraplaque hemorrhage, and enhancement ratio. Clinical outcomes were assessed according to the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at day 90, with a favorable outcome being defined as a 90-day mRS <=2. Statistical Tests: The odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by a logistic regression model. Result(s): Hypertension (OR 5.2; 95% CI 2.6-10.3; P < 0.05) and hrMRI enhancement ratio (OR 2.7; 95% CI 1.4-5.1; P < 0.05) were independently associated with lesion type. Patients without hypertension had significantly more (P < 0.05) favorable outcomes (124/144) than patients with hypertension (97/149). Most hypertensive patients without any previous blood pressure control (54/63) had a favorable outcome. However, these patients were significantly younger (P < 0.05) than those with adequate blood pressure control. After adjusting for all significant characteristics, hypertension duration (OR 1.19; 95% CI 1.09-1.29; P < 0.05), hypertension management (OR 2.49; 95% CI 1.18-5.26; P < 0.05), and enhancement ratio (OR 0.01; 95% CI 0.001-0.157; P < 0.05) were found to be independent high-risk factors for outcome prediction.

Plasma levels of soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (sTREM-1) reflect innate immune cell activation. We sought to evaluate sTREM-1 levels in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and their predictive value for disease severity and outcome. Methods. Plasma sTREM-1 levels were prospectively measured by ELISA in 121 consecutive patients with new-onset (<=24 h) chest pain at arrival to the emergency department (ED) and 73 healthy controls. Secondary endpoints were the association of plasma levels of sTREM-1 with day 30 and month 6 major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) defined as death, ACS, stroke, and need for coronary revascularization, as well as with CAD severity. The primary endpoint of the study was the association of plasma sTREM-1 level at the time of admission to the ED with a diagnosis of ACS at day 30. Results. Fifty-nine patients (48.7%) were diagnosed with ACS and 62 (51.3%) with nonspecific chest pain (NSCP). Median plasma sTREM-1 level at admission was significantly higher in the ACS group than the NSCP group and the control group (539.4+/-330.3 pg/ml vs. 432.5+/-196.4 pg/ml vs. 230.1+/-85.5 pg/ml, respectively; P<0.001) and positively correlated with the number of stenosed/occluded coronary arteries on angiography (P<0.001). On logistic regression analysis, higher sTREM-1 levels predicted definite ACS vs. NSCP determined on day 30 (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.07-1.54, P=0.01) as well as with recurrent ACS (P=0.04) and stroke (P=0.02) at 6 months. Conclusions. Plasma sTREM-1 levels are significantly elevated in patients with ACS and might serve as a biomarker differentiating ACS from NSCP in the ED as well as an inflammatory biomarker for coronary artery disease severity and outcome.Copyright © 2021 Shachaf Shiber et al.","Authors":"Shiber, S.; Kliminski, V.; Orvin, K.; Sagy, I.; Vaturi, M.; Kornowski, R.; Drescher, M.; Molad, Y.","Publisher":"Mediators of Inflammation","Issue":"Not Available","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/8872686","Pages":"8872686","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (sTREM-1)"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":15,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":17,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":24,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":3404,"Title":"Clinical usefulness of quantification of myocardial blood flow and flow reserve using CZT-SPECT for detecting coronary artery disease in patients with normal stress perfusion imaging","Year":2020,"Country":"","Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Relative myocardial perfusion imaging can misdiagnose \"balanced\" ischemia caused by coronary artery disease (CAD).

MiR-19b-1-5p expression was measured from buffy coat of patients with ACS (n=945) by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Platelet function was determined by Multiplate aggregometry testing. MACCE was collected over a mean follow-up time of 1.01+/-0.43 years. Low miR-19b-1-5p expression was found to be related to aspirin resistance as could be observed from sustained platelet aggregation in the presence of aspirin (-Log-miR-19b-1-5p, [unstandardized beta, 44.50; 95% CI, 2.20-86.80; P<0.05]), even after adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, and prior history of stroke. Lower miR-19b-1-5p expression was independently associated with a higher risk of MACCE (-Log-miR-19b-1-5p, [hazard ratio, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.23-2.80; P<0.05]). Furthermore, a significant interaction was noted between the inverse miR-19b-1-5p expression and family history of premature coronary artery disease (P=0.01) on the risk of MACCE. Conclusions Lower miR-19b-1-5p expression was found to be associated with sustained platelet aggregation on aspirin, and a higher risk of MACCE in patients with ACS. Therefore, miR-19b-1-5p could be a suitable marker for aspirin resistance and might predict recurrence of MACCE in patients with ACS.","Authors":"Singh, Sandeep; de Ronde, Maurice W.

The link between insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease is complex and multifactorial. Confirming the genetic link between insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and coronary artery disease, as well as the extent of coronary artery disease, is important and may provide better risk stratification for patients at risk. We investigated whether a genetic risk score of 53 single nucleotide polymorphisms known to be associated with insulin resistance phenotypes was associated with diabetes and burden of coronary artery disease., METHODS AND RESULTS: We genotyped patients with a coronary angiography performed in the capital region of Denmark from 2010-2014 and constructed a genetic risk score of the 53 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Logistic regression using quartiles of the genetic risk score was performed to determine associations with diabetes and coronary artery disease. Associations with the extent of coronary artery disease, defined as one-, two- or three-vessel coronary artery disease, was determined by multinomial logistic regression. We identified 4,963 patients, of which 17% had diabetes and 55% had significant coronary artery disease. Of the latter, 27%, 14% and 14% had one, two or three-vessel coronary artery disease, respectively. No significant increased risk of diabetes was identified comparing the highest genetic risk score quartile with the lowest. An increased risk of coronary artery disease was found for patients with the highest genetic risk score quartile in both unadjusted and adjusted analyses, OR 1.21 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.42, p = 0.02) and 1.25 (95% CI 1.06, 1.48, p<0.01), respectively. In the adjusted multinomial logistic regression, patients in the highest genetic risk score quartile were more likely to develop three-vessel coronary artery disease compared with patients in the lowest genetic risk score quartile, OR 1.41 (95% CI: 1.10, 1.82, p<0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: Among patients referred for coronary angiography, only a strong genetic predisposition to insulin resistance was associated with risk of coronary artery disease and with a greater disease burden.","Authors":"Skals, Regitze; Krogager, Maria Lukacs; Appel, Emil Vincent R.; Schnurr, Theresia M.; Have, Christian Theil; Gislason, Gunnar; Poulsen, Henrik Enghusen; Kober, Lars; Engstrom, Thomas; Stender, Steen; Hansen, Torben; Grarup, Niels; Lee, Christina Ji-Young; Andersson, Charlotte; Torp-Pedersen, Christian; Weeke, Peter E.","Publisher":"PloS one","Issue":"6","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252855","Pages":"e0252855","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"genetic risk score of 53 SNPs associated with insulin resistance"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":3454,"Title":"Mild impairment of renal function (shrunken pore syndrome) is associated with increased risk of a future first-ever myocardial infarction in women","Year":2021,"Country":"","Abstract":"Impaired renal function is associated both with the development of cardiovascular disease and its prognosis. A new syndrome called 'Shrunken Pore Syndrome' has been suggested, as the estimated glomerular filtration rate for cystatin C (eGFRcystatin C) is affected earlier due to differences in molecular size compared to eGFRcreatinine. The aim was to investigate if a lower eGFRcystatin C/eGFRcreatinine ratio in a prospective setting increases the risk of later developing a first-ever myocardial infarction (MI) independently of other cardiovascular risk factors. We used a nested case-referent study design within the Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study, and 545 subjects (29.0% women) were identified who prospectively developed a first-ever MI, and their 1054 matched referents. For women, but not for men, one standard deviation (SD) increase of ln z-scores of eGFRcystatin C/eGFRcreatinine ratio was associated with a lower risk of a future MI: odds ratio [95% confidence interval] 0.58 [0.34-0.99], adjusted for apolipoprotein B/A1 ratio, CRP, homocysteine, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, and diabetes. Furthermore, a high eGFRcreatinine associated independently with an increased risk of future MI in men only: OR 1.25 [1.05-1.48]. Thus, for women, a lower eGFRcystatin C/eGFRcreatinine ratio is associated with a higher risk of having a future first-ever MI, and it may be a valuable, easily implemented biomarker for risk of cardiovascular disease.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

Materials and methods In this prospective study, 380 MI patients were included. Participants were grouped into low sST2 (n = 264, mean age: 60.0 +/- 12.1 years) and high sST2 groups (n = 116, mean age: 60.5 +/- 11.6 years), and all study populations were followed up for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) which are composed of CV mortality, target vessel revascularization (TVR), non-fatal reinfarction, stroke and heart failure. Results During a 12-month follow-up, 68 (17.8%) patients had MACE. CV mortality and heart failure were significantly higher in the high sST2 group compared to the low sST2 group (15.5% vs. 4.9%, p = 0.001 and 8.6% vs. 3.4% p = 0.032, respectively).

Besides, older age, Killip class >1, left anterior descending (LAD) as the culprit artery and lower systolic blood pressure were the other independent risk factors for 1-year CV mortality. Conclusions High sST2 levels are an important predictor of MACE, including CV mortality and heart failure in a 1-year follow-up period in MI patients.","Authors":"Somuncu, Mustafa Umut; Kalayci, Belma; Avci, Ahmet; Akgun, Tunahan; Karakurt, Huseyin; Demir, Ali Riza; Avci, Yalcin; Can, Murat","Publisher":"Hormone molecular biology and clinical investigation","Issue":"2","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1515/hmbci-2019-0062","Pages":"Not Available","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"Soluble suppression of tumorigenicity 2 (sST2)"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":3,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":18,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":24,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":3475,"Title":"Benefits and Risks of CT Angiography Immediately after Emergency Arrival for Patients with Intracerebral Hematoma","Year":2020,"Country":"","Abstract":"Computed tomography angiography (CTA) immediately after diagnosis of intracerebral hematoma (ICH) on noncontrast CT in the emergency room has benefits, which consist of early diagnosis of secondary ICH and prediction of hematoma growth using the spot sign in primary ICH, but CTA also involves possible risks of acute kidney injury (AKI) and adverse reactions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the benefits and risks of CTA. A total of 1423 consecutive adult patients diagnosed with ICH who were admitted within 3 days of onset between 2010 and 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. Of 1082 patients undergoing CTA, 162 patients (15.0%) showed secondary ICH, and the sensitivity of CTA for secondary ICH was 95.7%. Of 920 patients with primary ICH, a logistic regression model using the spot sign and four other previously reported risk factors (antiplatelet agents, anticoagulants, interval from onset to arrival, hematoma volume) with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.787 significantly improved model performance to predict hematoma growth compared with a model using the same four factors without the spot sign (AUC: 0.697) (DeLong's test: P = 0.0002). Rates of AKI occurrence were 9.0% and 9.8% in patients with and without CTA, respectively. The odds ratio of AKI in patients with CTA adjusted by reported risk factors was 1.16 (95% confidence interval: 0.72-1.95, P = 0.5548). Emergency CTA following noncontrast CT in patients with ICH could be useful for early diagnosis of secondary ICH and prediction of hematoma growth using the spot sign in primary ICH with little risk.","Authors":"Sorimachi, Takatoshi; Atsumi, Hideki; Yonemochi, Takuya; Hirayama, Akihiro; Shigematsu, Hideaki; Srivatanakul, Kittipong; Takizawa, Shunya; Matsumae, Mitsunori","Publisher":"Neurologia medico-chirurgica","Issue":"1","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.2176/nmc.oa.2019-0152","Pages":"45-52","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"CT angiography"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":3,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":18,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":24,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":3480,"Title":"Correlation between left atrial spontaneous echocardiographic contrast and 5-year stroke/death in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation","Year":2020,"Country":"","Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) can be used to detect the presence of left atrial thrombus and left atrial spontaneous echocardiographic contrast (LASEC)., AIM: To evaluate the prognostic value of TTE and TOE in predicting stroke and all-cause death at 5-year follow-up in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF)., METHODS: This study included patients hospitalised with electrocardiography-diagnosed NVAF in Saint-Antoine University Hospital, Paris, between July 1998 and December 2011, who underwent TTE and TOE evaluation within 24hours of admission.

The aims of this study were, therefore, to characterize novel biomarkers, metabolic disruptions, and mechanisms involving ICH. A total 30 ICH patients and 30 controls were enrolled in the study, and their clinical characteristics were analyzed. Nontargeted metabolomic analysis was conducted using ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF). Multivariate statistical analysis and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis were used for screening and evaluating the predictive ability of biomarkers. ICH patients showed significantly higher systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, blood glucose levels, white blood cell counts, neutrophil count, percentage of neutrophils and globulin and a lower albumin/globin ratio when compared with controls. In sum, 11 important metabolites were identified, which were associated with disruption of fatty acid oxidation and sphingolipid and phospholipid metabolism, as well as increased inflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular pathologies. Further multiple logistic regression analyses of these metabolites showed that l-carnitine and phosphatidylcholine (20:3/22:6) have potential as biomarkers of ICH, and the area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity were 0.974, 90%, and 93%, respectively.

We hypothesized that the respective biomarkers may be involved in the development of uremic cardiomyopathy characteristics and can be useful in their identification among chronic kidney disease patients. Method(s): We assessed traditional and non-traditional cardiovascular risk factors including biomarker concentrations and determined central systolic blood pressure using SphygmoCor software and cardiac structure and function by echocardiography in 109 (64 non-dialysis and 45 dialysis) patients. Associations were evaluated in multivariate regression models and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Result(s): Each biomarker concentration was associated with left ventricular mass beyond stroke work and/or inappropriate left ventricular mass in all, non-dialysis and/or dialysis patients. Ferritin, albumin and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels were additionally associated with E/e' in all, non-dialysis and/or dialysis patients. Dialysis status influenced the relationship of uric acid concentrations with inappropriate left ventricular mass and those of gamma-glutamyl transferase levels with left ventricular mass and inappropriate left ventricular mass. In stratified analysis, low uric acid levels were related to inappropriate left ventricular mass in dialysis but not non-dialysis patients (interaction p=0.001) whereas gamma-glutamyl transferase concentrations were associated with left ventricular mass and inappropriate left ventricular mass in non-dialysis but not dialysis patients (interaction p=0.020 to 0.036). In ROC curve analysis, uric acid (area under the curve (AUC)=0.877), ferritin (AUC=0.703) and albumin (AUC=0.728) concentrations effectively discriminated between dialysis patients with and without inappropriate left ventricular hypertrophy, left ventricular hypertrophy, and increased E/e,' respectively. Conclusion(s): Uric acid, ferritin, albumin, parathyroid hormone and gamma-glutamyl transferase were associated with uremic cardiomyopathy characteristics and could be useful in their identification. Our findings merit validation in future longitudinal studies.Copyright © 2022 Tade et al. T","Authors":"Tade, G.; Hsu, H. C.; Woodiwiss, A.

Overt disease is preceded by a pre-symptomatic phase of variable length in which disease expression seems to be absent., METHODS: PLN p.Arg14del mutation carriers with an available echocardiogram were included. Mutation carriers were classified as pre-symptomatic if they had no history of ventricular arrhythmias (VAs), a premature ventricular complex count of <500/24 h, and a left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction of >=45%. In addition, we included 70 control subjects with similar age and sex distribution as the pre-symptomatic mutation carriers. Comprehensive echocardiographic analysis (including deformation imaging) was performed., RESULTS: The final study population consisted of 281 PLN p.Arg14del mutation carriers, 139 of whom were classified as pre-symptomatic. In comparison to control subjects, pre-symptomatic mutation carriers had lower global longitudinal strain and higher LV mechanical dispersion (both p < 0.001). In addition, post-systolic shortening (PSS) in the LV apex was observed in 43 pre-symptomatic mutation carriers (31%) and in none of the control subjects. During a median follow-up of 3.2 years (interquartile range: 2.1 to 5.6 years) in 104 pre-symptomatic mutation carriers, nonsustained VA occurred in 13 (13%). Presence of apical PSS was the strongest echocardiographic predictor of VA (multivariable hazards ratio: 5.11; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.37 to 19.08; p = 0.015), which resulted in a negative predictive value of 96% (95% CI: 89% to 98%) and a positive predictive value of 29% (95% CI: 21% to 40%)., CONCLUSIONS: Global and regional LV mechanical alterations in PLN p.Arg14del mutation carriers precede arrhythmic symptoms and overt structural disease. Pre-symptomatic mutation carriers with normal deformation patterns in the apex are at low risk of developing VA within 3 years, whereas mutation carriers with apical PSS appear to be at higher risk.

This prospective multicenter study assessed 3,283 consecutive patients with AMI admitted to 28 institutions in Japan between 2012 and 2014. We analyzed 218 patients with NSTEMI without CK elevation (NSTEMI-CK) for whom BNP was available. In the NSTEMI-CK group, patients were assigned to high-and low-BNP groups according to BNP values (cut-off BNP, 100 pg/mL). The primary endpoint was defined as a composite of all-cause death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, cardiac failure, and urgent revascularization for unstable angina up to 3 years. Primary endpoints were observed in 60 (33.3%) events among patients with NSTEMI-CK. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a significantly higher event rate for primary endpoints among patients with high BNP (log-rank P < 0.001). After adjusting for covariates, a higher BNP level was significantly associated with long-term clinical outcomes in NSTEMI-CK (adjusted hazard ratio, 4.86; 95% confidence interval, 2.18-12.44; P < 0.001). The BNP concentration is associated with adverse long-term clinical outcomes among patients with NSTEMI-CK who are considered low risk.

LASr could be used in LV diastolic dysfunction grading with an excellent discriminatory power. Our objectives were to assess the impact and existing correlations between LASr and cardiovascular outcomes, as reported in clinical trials, including patients with CKD. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for full-text papers. As reported in clinical studies, LASr was associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, including cardiovascular death and major adverse cardiovascular events (HR 0.89, 95% CI, 0.84-0.93, p < 0.01), paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (OR 0.847, 95% CI, 0.760-0.944, p = 0.003), reduced exercise capacity (AUC 0.83, 95% CI, 0.78-0.88, p < 0.01), diastolic dysfunction (p < 0.05), and estimated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (p < 0.001).

Material(s) and Method(s): Among 677 patients enrolled in a multicenter observational CS registry, 300 patients (44%) had PFOs detected by transesophageal echocardiography. They were classified into probable PFO-related stroke (RoPE score>6, n = 32) and stroke with incidental PFO (RoPE score<=6, n = 268) groups, and clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, cardiac and echocardiographic markers (i.e. brain natriuretic peptide, left atrial [LA] diameter, ejection fraction, early transmitral flow velocity/early diastolic tissue Doppler imaging velocity [E/e'], LA appendage flow velocity, spontaneous echo contrast, atrial septal aneurysm, substantial PFO, and aortic arch plaques), stroke recurrence, and excellent outcome (modified Rankin scale score <2) at discharge were compared. Risk factors for low RoPE scores were determined using multiple logistic regression analysis. Result(s): Higher brain natriuretic peptide levels (p = 0.032), LA enlargement (p < 0.001), higher E/e' (p = 0.001), lower LA appendage flow velocity (p < 0.001), non-substantial PFO (p = 0.021), and aortic arch plaques (p = 0.002) were associated with the low RoPE score group.

One of the factors that affect the occurrence of stroke can be attributed to changes in the levels of trace elements. Accumulating evidence has been shown that magnesium, as an important element, is a new predictor of stroke. We aimed to determine the levels of Mg in ischemic stroke patients in comparison with those having the hemorrhagic type. Method(s): This study was conducted on 447 stroke patients. Demographic characteristics of patients, stroke severity, and risk factors such as hypertension, ischemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia were recorded. Stroke was diagnosed based on the neurological examination and neuroimaging findings e.g. computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The colorimetric technique was used to determine the concentration of Mg at 450 nm according to the commercial kit. Result(s): The mean of magnesium levels in ischemic patients was significantly higher than that in the hemorrhagic patients (P=0.001). Difference in magnesium status was associated with gender in thrombotic patients (P<0.05), while hyperlipidemia was associated with the status of magnesium in embolic patients (P=0.012). Furthermore, magnesium levels were correlated with ischemic heart disease in embolic (P=0.011) and sub-arachnoid hemorrhagic (SAH) patients (P=0.012), and with diabetes mellitus in thrombotic patients (P=0.012). Magnesium status was associated with the severity of ischemic stroke at the time of discharge in ischemic patients (P<0.001). Mg levels had the best area under curve (AUC) for the discrimination of ischemic patients from hemorrhagic ones. Conclusion(s): Magnesium levels were higher in ischemic patients compared to hemorrhagic ones, and these levels were associated with many risk factors contributing to a stroke.

To gain mech-anistic insight, follow-up lipid analysis was undertaken in a mouse model that has an insulin-resistant heart and is susceptible to AF. Sphingolipids, cholesteryl esters, and phospholipids were associated with AF prevalence, whereas two monosialodihexosylganglioside (GM3) gan-glioside species were associated with future AF. For AF detection and prediction, addition of six and three lipids, respectively, to a base model (n = 12 conventional risk factors) increased the C-statistics (detection: from 0.661 to 0.725; prediction: from 0.674 to 0.715) and cate-gorical net reclassification indices.

DSC-MRP images of these subjects were manually inspected for collateral assessment in arterial, capillary, early and late venous, and delay phases. The proposed network was trained on 205 subjects, and the optimal model was chosen using the validation set of 64 subjects. The predictive power of the network was assessed on the test set of 76 subjects using the squared correlation coefficient (R-squared), mean absolute error (MAE), Tanimoto measure (TM), and structural similarity index (SSIM). Result(s): The proposed network was able to predict the five phase maps with high accuracy. On average, 0.897 R-squared, 0.581 x 10-1 MAE, 0.946 TM, and 0.846 SSIM were achieved for the five phase maps. No statistically significant difference was, in general, found between controls and stroke cases. The performance of the proposed network was lower in the arterial and venous phases than the other three phases. Conclusion(s): The results suggested that the proposed network performs equally well for both control and acute ischemic stroke groups. The proposed network could help automate the assessment of collateral status in an efficient and effective manner and improve the quality and yield of diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke. The follow-up study will entail the clinical evaluation of the collateral images that are generated by the proposed network.Copyright © 2019, CARS.","Authors":"To, M. N. N.; Kim, H. J.; Roh, H.

Nevertheless, few studies have assessed them among patients with acute ischemic stroke undergoing mechanical endovascular thrombectomy (MET). The overall objective in this study was to evaluate these predictors in patients undergoing MET in the purpose to guide the medical care in the acute phase. Method(s): We selected patients from a prospective local database which reference all patients eligible for treatment with Alteplase thrombolysis and/or mechanical endovascular thrombectomy in acute stroke. We investigated demographic, clinical, and radiological data. Multivariate regression analysis was used to identify clinical and imaging predictors of MMI. Result(s): In 32 months, 66 patients were included. Eighteen (27.3%) developed MMI. Malignant evolution was associated with: severity of neurological deficit and level of consciousness at admission, infarct size in DWI sequence and involvement of other vascular territories. Study groups didn't differ in terms of successful reperfusion. Two variables were identified as independent predictors of MMI: DWI infarct volume (p < 0.001) and time to thrombectomy (p = 0.018). A decision tree based on these two factors was able to predict malignant evolution with high specificity (100%) and sensibility (73%). Conclusion(s): Our study proposes a practical decision tree including DWI lesion volume and delay before thrombectomy to early and accurately predict MMI in a subgroup of patients with MCA infarction undergoing MET regardless to the status of reperfusion.Copyright © 2020","Authors":"Tracol, C.; Vannier, S.; Hurel, C.; Tuffier, S.; Eugene, F.; Le Reste, P.

However, whether liver fibrosis scores can be used to predict atherosclerosis progression, especially for patients with low calcium scores, remains undetermined., METHODS: A total of 165 subjects who underwent repeated coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and had low calcium scores (<100) were enrolled. The segment stenosis score (SSS) from the CCTA was measured, and the association between SSS progression and biochemical parameters was analyzed in addition to liver fibrosis scores, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score (NFS), fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet ratio index (APRI), and Forns score., RESULTS: When compared with those without plaque at baseline (SSS = 0), subjects with plaque had higher blood pressure, higher coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores, and higher liver fibrosis scores, including Forns score, Fib-4, and NFS. During the medium follow-up interval of 24.7 months, 60 (39.4%) patients displayed SSS progression, while the remaining 105 (63.6%) patients showed no CAD progression. In a multivariate analysis, being male having a high diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and having a high NFS liver fibrosis score were independently associated with the odds ratio for SSS progression., CONCLUSIONS: Higher baseline blood pressure and liver fibrosis markers are associated with the presence of coronary artery disease (CAD) plaques in subjects in early CAD stages. For disease progression, the male gender, DBP, and NFS appear to be independently associated with coronary atherosclerosis plaque progression in subjects with low calcium scores.","Authors":"Tsai, Tsung-Ying; Hsu, Pai-Feng; Wu, Cheng-Hsueh; Huang, Shao-Sung; Chan, Wan-Leong; Lin, Shing-Jong; Chen, Jaw-Wen; Lu, Tse-Min; Leu, Hsin-Bang","Publisher":"Nutrients","Issue":"15","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu14153163","Pages":"Not Available","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"liver fibrosis scores"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":8,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":17,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":25,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":3705,"Title":"Pole Test and Ankle-Brachial Index by Using Doppler Ultrasound for Peripheral Arterial Disease in End-Stage Renal Disease Patients","Year":2020,"Country":"","Abstract":"Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) causes great disability in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Pole test is a simplified test utilizing the basis of Doppler ultrasound invented to correct false elevation in ankle-brachial index (ABI) in diabetic patients with severe calcification of the tibial artery. However, the role of pole test in ESRD patients is still unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the sensitivity, specificity, and overall utility of pole tests in such patients. One hundred and four patients were recruited and examined with 3 tests: pole test, ABI, and toe-brachial index, the latter serving as the gold standard. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed using SPSS version 22.0. The sensitivity, specificity, and other diagnostic values of ABI and pole tests were calculated. There were 104 ESRD patients enrolled. Pole tests showed to have low probability to provide accurate results (area under the curve = 0.505, standard error = 0.042). Low sensitivity of ABI (34.96%) can be observed in ESRD patients. Specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of ABI in all cases were, respectively, 85.91%, 81.13%, and 43.26%. It is concluded that pole test accuracy seemed to be limited in ESRD patients. ABI was found to be confounded by medial arterial calcification, resulting in low sensitivity as well. The results of this study permit the observation that an optimal tool for screening peripheral arterial disease in ESRD patients remains to be discovered.","Authors":"Tungsrirut, Nutthanun; Taptiang, Krittitee; Charoenkarn, Kairawee; Piyachon, Pavarit; Srisittipoj, Pitipong; Rerkasem, Kittipan","Publisher":"The international journal of lower extremity wounds","Issue":"4","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1534734620951528","Pages":"359-363","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"pole test and ankle-brachial index (ABI)"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":18,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":3743,"Title":"Persistently elevated levels of sST2 after acute coronary syndrome are associated with recurrent cardiac events","Year":2022,"Country":"","Abstract":"PURPOSE: Higher soluble ST2 (sST2) levels at admission are associated with adverse outcome in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients.

However, the evolution of calcified coronary plaques by noninvasive imaging is not known., Objective: To ascertain whether the increasing density in calcified coronary plaque is associated with risk for ACS., Design, Setting, and Participants: This multicenter case-control cohort study included individuals enrolled in ICONIC (Incident Coronary Syndromes Identified by Computed Tomography), a nested case-control study of patients drawn from the CONFIRM (Coronary CT Angiography Evaluation for Clinical Outcomes: An International Multicenter) registry, which included 13 study sites in 8 countries. Patients who experienced core laboratory-verified ACS after baseline CCTA (n = 189) and control individuals who did not experience ACS after baseline CCTA (n = 189) were included. Patients and controls were matched 1:1 by propensity scores for age; male sex; presence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes; family history of premature coronary artery disease (CAD); current smoking status; and CAD severity. Data were analyzed from November 2018 to March 2019., Exposures: Whole-heart atherosclerotic plaque volume was quantitated from all coronary vessels and their branches. For patients who underwent invasive angiography at the time of ACS, culprit lesions were coregistered to baseline CCTA lesions by a blinded independent reader. Low-density plaque was defined as having less than 130 Hounsfield units (HU); calcified plaque, as having more than 350 HU and subcategorized on a voxel-level basis into 3 strata: 351 to 700 HU, 701 to 1000 HU, and more than 1000 HU (termed 1K plaque)., Main Outcomes and Measures: Association between calcium density and future ACS risk., Results: A total of 189 patients and 189 matched controls (mean [SD] age of 59.9 [9.8] years; 247 [65.3%] were male) were included in the analysis and were monitored during a mean (SD) follow-up period of 3.9 (2.5) years. The overall mean (SD) calcified plaque volume (>350 HU) was similar between patients and controls (76.4 [101.6] mm3 vs 99.0 [156.1] mm3; P = .32), but patients who experienced ACS exhibited less 1K plaque (>1000 HU) compared with controls (3.9 [8.3] mm3 vs 9.4 [23.2] mm3; P = .02). Individuals within the highest quartile of 1K plaque exhibited less low-density plaque, as a percentage of total plaque, when compared with patients within the lower 3 quartiles (12.6% [10.4%] vs 24.9% [20.6%]; P < .001). For 93 culprit precursor lesions detected by CCTA, the volume of 1K plaque was lower compared with the maximally stenotic lesion in controls (2.6 [7.2] mm3 vs 7.6 [20.3] mm3; P = .01). The per-patient and per-lesion results were similar between the 2 groups when restricted to myocardial infarction cases., Conclusions and Relevance: Results of this study suggest that, on a per-patient and per-lesion basis, 1K plaque was associated with a lower risk for future ACS and that measurement of 1K plaque may improve risk stratification beyond plaque burden.","Authors":"van Rosendael, Alexander R.; Narula, Jagat; Lin, Fay Y.; van den Hoogen, Inge J.; Gianni, Umberto; Al Hussein Alawamlh, Omar; Dunham, Patricia C.; Pena, Jessica M.; Lee, Sang-Eun; Andreini, Daniele; Cademartiri, Filippo; Chinnaiyan, Kavitha; Chow, Benjamin J.

Thus, biomarkers predicting the occurrence of this pathology are of great importance from a clinical and therapeutic standpoint. By means of a pilot study on peripheral blood cells (PBMCs) of subjects with no coronary lesions (CTR; n = 2) and patients with stable CAD (CAD; n = 2), we revealed 61 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) (18 promoter regions, 24 genes and 19 CpG islands) and 14.997 differentially methylated single CpG sites (DMCs) in CAD patients. MiRNA-seq results displayed a peculiar miRNAs profile in CAD patients with 18 upregulated and 32 downregulated miRNAs (FC >= +/-1.5, p <= 0.05). An integrated analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation and miRNA-seq results indicated a significant downregulation of hsa-miR-200c-3p (FCCAD = -2.97, p <= 0.05) associated to the hypermethylation of two sites (genomic coordinates: chr12:7073122-7073122 and chr12:7072599-7072599) located intragenic to the miR-200c/141 genomic locus (encoding hsa-miR-200c-3p) (p-value = 0.009) in CAD patients. We extended the hsa-miR-200c-3p expression study in a larger cohort (CAD = 72, CTR = 24), confirming its reduced expression level in CAD patients (FCCAD = -2; p = 0.02). However, when we analyzed the methylation status of the two CpG sites in the same cohort, we failed to identify significant differences. A ROC curve analysis showed good performance of hsa-miR-200c-3p expression level (AUC = 0.65; p = 0.02) in distinguishing CAD from CTR. Moreover, we found a significant positive correlation between hsa-miR-200c-3p expression and creatinine clearance (R2 = 0.212, p < 0.005, Pearson r = 0.461) in CAD patients. Finally, a phenotypic correlation performed in the CAD group revealed lower hsa-miR-200c-3p expression levels in CAD patients affected by dyslipidemia (+DLP, n = 58) (p < 0.01). These results indicate hsa-miR-200c-3p as potential epi-biomarker for the diagnosis and clinical progression of CAD and highlight the importance of deeper studies on the expression of this miRNA to understand its functional role in coronary artery disease development.","Authors":"Vancheri, Chiara; Morini, Elena; Prandi, Francesca Romana; Barilla, Francesco; Romeo, Francesco; Novelli, Giuseppe; Amati, Francesca","Publisher":"International journal of molecular sciences","Issue":"2","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms24021112","Pages":"Not Available","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"hsa-miR-200c-3"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":15,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":24,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":3776,"Title":"Association of Epicardial Fat Volume With the Extent of Coronary Atherosclerosis and Cardiovascular Adverse Events in Asymptomatic Patients With Diabetes","Year":2021,"Country":"","Abstract":"Epicardial adipose tissue has a paracrine effect, enhancing coronary artery atherosclerotic plaque development.

Since atrial fibrillation (AF) can be detected in up to 30% of CS, there is a clinical need for estimating the probability of underlying AF in CS to guide the optimal secondary prevention strategy. The aim of the study was to develop the first comprehensive predictive score including clinical conditions, biomarkers, and left atrial strain (LAS), to predict AF detection in this setting., METHODS: Sixty-three consecutive patients with IS or transient ischemic attack with ABCD2 scale >= 4 of unknown etiology were prospectively recruited. Clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic variables were collected. All patients underwent 15 days wearable Holter-ECG monitoring. Main objective was the Decryptoring score creation to predict AF in CS. Score variables were selected by a univariate analysis and, thereafter, score points were derived according to a multivariant analysis., RESULTS: AF was detected in 15 patients (24%). Age > 75 (9 points), hypertension (1 point), Troponin T > 40 ng/L (8.5 points), NTproBNP > 200 pg/ml (0.5 points), LAS reservoir < 25.3% (24.5 points) and LAS conduct < 10.4% (0.5 points) were included in the score. The rate of AF detection was 0% among patients with a score of < 10 and 80% among patients with a score > 35. The comparison of the predictive validity between the proposed score and AF-ESUS score resulted in an AUC of 0.94 for Decryptoring score and of 0.65 for the AF-ESUS score(p < 0.001)., CONCLUSION: This novel score offers an accurate AF prediction in patients with CS; however these results will require validation in an independent cohort using this model before they may be translated into clinical practice.

Thus, this study aimed to identify TIA and aCI biomarkers. Method(s): In 19 patients with TIA, candidate antigens recognized by serum IgG autoantibodies were screened using a human aortic endothelial cell cDNA library. Through amplified luminescent proximity homogeneous assay-linked immunosorbent assay (AlphaLISA), serum antibody levels against the candidate antigens were examined in healthy donor (HD), TIA, and aCI cohorts (n = 285, 92, and 529). The plasma antibody levels in the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Cohort Study (1991-1993) were also examined. Result(s): The candidate antigens were aldolase A (ALDOA) and fumarate hydratase (FH). In AlphaLISA, patients with TIA or aCI had higher anti-ALDOA antibody (ALDOA-Ab) and anti-FH antibody (FH-Ab) levels than the HDs (P < 0.05). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, the ALDOA-Ab (odds ratio [OR]: 2.46, P = 0.0050) and FH-Ab (OR: 2.49, P = 0.0037) levels were independent predictors of TIA. According to the case-control study, the ALDOA-Ab (OR: 2.50, P < 0.01) and FH-Ab (OR: 2.60, P < 0.01) levels were associated with aCI risk. In a correlation analysis, both ALDOA-Abs and FH-Abs were well associated with hypertension, coronary heart disease, and habitual smoking.

Method(s): A total of 1,580 ischemic stroke patients were enrolled in this retrospective study conducted from January 2018 to April 2021. Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared between recurrence and non-recurrence groups. On DWI, lesions were segmented using a 2D U-Net automatic segmentation network. Further, radiomics feature extraction was done using the segmented mask matrix on DWI and the corresponding ADC map. Additionally, radiomics features were extracted. The study participants were divided into a training cohort (n = 157, 57 recurrence patients, and 100 non-recurrence patients) and a test cohort (n = 846, 28 recurrence patients, 818 non-recurrence patients). A sparse representation feature selection model was performed to select features. Further classification was accomplished using a recurrent neural network (RNN). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values was obtained for model performance. Result(s): A total of 1,003 ischemic stroke patients (682 men and 321 women; mean age: 65.90 +/- 12.44 years) were included in the final analysis. About 85 patients (8.5%) recurred in 1 year, and patients in the recurrence group were older than the non-recurrence group (P = 0.003). The stroke subtype was significantly different between recurrence and non-recurrence groups, and cardioembolic stroke (11.3%) and large artery atherosclerosis patients (10.3%) showed a higher recurrence percentage (P = 0.005). Secondary prevention after discharge (statins, antiplatelets, and anticoagulants) was found significantly different between the two groups (P = 0.004). The area under the curve (AUC) of clinical-based model and radiomics-based model were 0.675 (95% CI: 0.643-0.707) and 0.779 (95% CI: 0.750-0.807), respectively. With an AUC of 0.847 (95% CI: 0.821-0.870), the model that combined clinical and radiomic characteristics performed better.

Multiple biomarkers have been shown to improve risk stratification in patients with ACS. However, the utility of biomarkers for prognostic stratification in patients with ACS without SMuRFs remains uncertain. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prognostic value of various biomarkers in patents with ACS without SMuRFs. Method(s): Data of consecutive patients with ACS without SMuRFs who underwent coronary angiography in Tianjin Chest Hospital between January 2014 and December 2017 were retrospectively collected. The primary outcome was the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE), defined as a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction and stroke. Seven candidate biomarkers analyses were analyzed using models adjusted for established risk factors. Result(s): During a median 5-year follow-up, 81 of the 621 patients experienced a MACE. After adjustment for important covariates, elevated fibrinogen, D-dimer, N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] were found to be individually associated with MACE. However, only D-dimer, NT-proBNP and Lp(a) significantly improved risk reclassification for MACE (all P < 0.05). The multimarker analysis showed that there was a clear increase in the risk of MACE with an increasing number of elevated biomarkers and a higher multimarker score. The adjusted hazard ratio- for MACE (95% confidential intervals) for patients with 4 elevated biomarkers was 6.008 (1.9650-18.367) relative to those without any elevated biomarker-. Adding- the 4 biomarkers or the multimarker score to the basic model significantly improved the C-statistic value, the net reclassification index and the integrated discrimination index (all P < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Fibrinogen, D-dimer, NT-proBNP and Lp(a) provided valuable prognostic information for MACE when applied to patients with ACS without SMuRFs. The multimarker strategy, which combined multiple biomarkers reflecting different pathophysiological process with traditional risk factors improved the cardiovascular risk stratification.Copyright © 2022 Wang, Cong, Zhang, Li, Hu, Wang, Lang, Zhou, Li, Liu, Yang, Ren, Qi and Li.","Authors":"Wang, L.; Cong, H.

This is the first multi-ethnic population-based study to use these serum biomarkers for preventive strategy. No association was found between RANTES, EMMPRIN, MMP2, and MMP9 with CVD. What is the implication of the main findings? Our research improves the understanding of inflammatory biomarkers in the cardiovascular field. Currently, these biomarkers are ineffective for risk stratification or diagnosis when used as a single indicator. Prevention of CVD still requires a comprehensive evaluation of CVD risk factors. Background(s): The growing cardiovascular disease (CVD) epidemic calls for further research to identify novel biomarkers for earlier detection and as potential therapeutic targets. Biomarkers Regulated on Activation, Normal T Cell Expressed and Secreted (RANTES), extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2, and MMP-9) are linked to proatherogenic and proinflammatory pathways of CVD development, the majority of which are coronary artery disease (CAD) and stroke. We evaluated potential factors affecting these four biomarkers and established their association with CVD. Method(s): This is a cross-sectional analysis using a nested case-control design involving 580 participants aged 21-75 years from the prospective multi-ethnic cohort study. A total of 290 CVD cases and 290 age-and sex-matched controls were identified. All participants underwent interviews, health screenings, and provided blood samples, including biomarkers RANTES, EMMPRIN, and MMPs. CVD was defined based on previous medical history. Result(s): The average age of the participants was 55.7(SD = 10.3) years of age, and 34.6% were female. Arrhythmia history and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels were significant factors of logEMMPRIN (beta = -0.124 [-0.245, -0.003] and beta = 0.111 [0.0, 0.191], respectively). Only female sex (beta = 0.189 [0.078, 0.300]) for logRANTES and age (beta = 0.033 [0.010, 0.055]) for logMMP-2 and logMMP-9 were significant. The Indian ethnicity (beta = 0.192 [0.048, 0.335]) and highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels (beta = 0.063 [0.011, 0.116]) were statistically significant for logMMP-9. No association was detected between biomarkers and CVD. Conclusion(s): In this multi-ethnic study cohort, RANTES was associated with sex, EMMPRIN was associated with a history of arrhythmia and LDL levels, MMP-2 with age, and MMP-9 with ethnicity and hs-CRP levels.

This study aimed to determine whether TNFRSF11B polymorphisms are associated with prognosis of large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) stroke. Three TNFRSF11B polymorphisms (rs2073617, rs2073618 and rs3134069) were genotyped in 1010 patients with LAA stroke. Short-term outcome was evaluated using the modified Rankin Scale score at 3-month after stroke onset. Long-term outcome was assessed using the stroke recurrence. We found that rs2073617G was associated with an increased risk of poor outcome of LAA stroke (additive model: odds ratio (OR) = 1.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.06-1.73). This association was also observed in rs3134069C (additive model: OR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.10-2.12). Furthermore, when we combined these two polymorphisms according to the numbers of risk alleles (rs2073617G and rs3134069C), we found that the patients with 3-4 risk alleles were statistically significantly associated with an increased risk of poor outcome of LAA stroke (OR = 1.90, 95% CI = 1.10-3.28) compared with 0-2 risk alleles, and this increased risk was more evident among those with hypertension (OR = 2.02, 95% CI = 1.04-3.91), those without diabetes (OR = 2.02, 95% CI = 1.02-4.01) and those with smoking (OR = 2.43, 95% CI = 1.09-5.42). In silico analysis showed that rs2073617 and rs3134069 are located in various histone modification marked regions, DNase I hypersensitive sites and can change the binding of regulatory motifs. Moreover, rs2073617 is also located in the binding site of transcription factors.

However, the long-term risk of cardiovascular events remains indistinct in patients with different level of FAR and different glycemic metabolism status. This study was to assess 5-year clinical outcomes of diabetic and non-diabetic patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with different level of FAR., METHODS: We consecutively enrolled 10,724 patients with CAD hospitalized for PCI and followed up for the major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) covering all-cause mortality, cardiac mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal ischemic stroke, and unplanned coronary revascularization. FAR was computed using the following formula: Fibrinogen (g/L)/Albumin (g/L). According to the optimal cut-off value of FAR for MACCE prediction, patients were divided into higher level of FAR (FAR-H) and lower level of FAR (FAR-L) subgroups, and were further categorized into four groups as FAR-H with DM and non-DM, and FAR-L with DM and non-DM., RESULTS: 5298 patients (58.36 +/- 10.36 years, 77.7% male) were ultimately enrolled in the present study. A total of 1099 (20.7%) MACCEs were documented during the 5-year follow-up. The optimal cut-off value of FAR was 0.0783 by the surv_cutpoint function. Compared to ones with FAR-H and DM, patients with FAR-L and non-DM, FAR-H and non-DM, FAR-L and DM had decreased risk of MACCEs [adjusted hazard ratio (HR): 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64-0.89, P = 0.001; HR: 0.78, 95% CI 0.66-0.93, P = 0.006; HR: 0.81, 95% CI 0.68-0.97, P = 0.019; respectively]. Notably, non-diabetic patients with lower level of FAR also had lower all-cause mortality and cardiac mortality risk than those in the FAR-H/DM group (HR: 0.41, 95% CI 0.27-0.63, P < 0.001; HR: 0.30, 95% CI 0.17-0.53, P < 0.001; respectively). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis also indicated the highest risk of MACCEs in patients with FAR-H and DM than others (P for trend = 0.005). In addition, post-hoc analysis revealed consistent effects on 5-year MACCE across various subgroups., CONCLUSION: In this real-world cohort study, higher level of FAR combined with DM was associated with worse 5-year outcomes among patients with CAD undergoing PCI. The level of FAR may help to identify high-risk individuals in this specific population, where more precise risk assessment should be performed. Copyright © 2022.

The results showed that global work efficiency (GWE) as the most significant predictor in all MW parameters had the optimal cut-off value of 94.5% for detecting moderate stenosis, and the sensitivity and specificity was 89.7% and 85.8%, respectively. A cut-off value of 94.0% for GWE was the most significant predictor of severe stenosis, and the sensitivity and specificity was 81.4% and 76.1%, respectively. In conclusion, LV global MW is a sensitive tool in detecting the degree of coronary artery stenosis and a potential valuable method to provide early diagnosis for CAD patients. Copyright © 2020.

Routine anthropometric and serologic data were collected. The severity of multivessel disease was assessed with the Gensini score after coronary angiography. The associations of serum cystatin C with the Gensini score were investigated, and the independent risk factors associated with multivessel disease were assessed., RESULTS: Serum cystatin C and the Gensini score were significantly elevated in diabetes patients. Cystatin C had a positive correlation with Gensini score. A multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that cystatin C was independently associated with the presence of multivessel disease (the OR score is 2.21, P = 0.003).

Although its incidence has been increasing, the pathogenesis of AF in stroke remains unclear. In this study, a total of 30 participants were recruited, including 10 controls, 10 patients with AF and 10 patients with AF and stroke (AF + STROKE). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, and functional annotation of DEGs, comparative toxicogenomic database analysis associated with cardiovascular diseases, and predictions of miRNAs of hub genes were performed. Using RT-qPCR, biological process and support vector machine neural networks, numerous DEGs were found to be related to AF. HBG1, SNCA and GYPB were found to be upregulated in the AF group. Higher expression of hub genes in AF and AF + STROKE groups was detected via RT-PCR. Upon training the biological process neural network of SNCA and GYPB for HBG1, only small differences were detected. Based on the support vector machine, the predicted value of SNCA and GYPB for HBG1 was 0.9893. Expression of the hub genes of HBG1, SNCA and GYPB might therefore be significantly correlated to AF. These genes are involved in the incidence of AF complicated by stroke, and may serve as targets for early diagnosis and treatment.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

The levels of matrix Gla protein (MGP) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) were measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method in 131 CKD patients of all. CAC was evaluated via computed tomography (CT). The covariate factors were analyzed by binary logistic regression analysis. We conducted the visits to explore the prevalence of CVE in 276 CKD patients, and covariate factors were analyzed by Cox proportional hazard model., RESULTS: The prevalence of CAC was up to 57.93%. We found that age, diabetes mellitus, hyperphosphatemia, dialysis duration, and the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were positively associated with CAC in all patients. In 131 patients, we demonstrated that higher IL-6 and lower MGP levels were associated with CAC. A Cox proportional hazard model demonstrated that moderate to severe CAC was correlated with an increased risk for CVE [Hazard Ratio (HR): 7.250; 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.192-16.470], and a higher MGP level was associated with a reduced risk for CVE (HR: 0.340; 95% CI: 0.124-0.933)., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of CAC in patients with CKD is a significant issue. Older age, hyperphosphatemia, dialysis duration, diabetes mellitus, IL-6, and the NLR are associated with CAC. In addition, higher MGP levels represent protective factor for CAC. Moderate to severe CAC, and lower MGP levels are associated with an increased risk for CVE.

This study aims to explore clinical biomarkers in the identification of ischemic stroke patients from people with dizziness and the prediction of their long-term recovery. Method(s): From January 2018 to June 2019, 21 ischemic stroke patients with a main complaint of dizziness, 84 non-stroke dizziness patients and 87 healthy volunteers were recruited in this study. Then, their peripheral blood samples were collected, and the percentages of circulating lymphocytes T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, T-/- cells (DNTs), CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), CD8+ Tregs, B cells and regulatory B cells (Bregs) were examined to identify biomarkers with clinical value. Result(s): According to our data, a significant difference in the DNTs proportion was detected between non-stroke dizziness and ischemic stroke patients with dizziness (p = 0.0009). The Bregs proportion in ischemic stroke patients with dizziness was lower than that in non-stroke dizziness patients (p = 0.035). In addition, the percentage of Bregs and DNTs within lymphocytes in patients' peripheral blood exhibited a significant negative correlation with stroke occurrence (Bregs, p = 0.039; DNTs, p = 0.046). Moreover, the Bregs and DNTs within lymphocytes were negatively related to participants' age, while presented a weak relationship with clinical risks like smoking, hypertension, and diabetes. Then, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of Bregs and DNTs together was 0.768, the risk factors and Bregs or DNTs ranged from 0.795 and 0.792, respectively, and the AUC value of risk factors, Bregs and DNTs combination was further increased to 0.815. Furthermore, the Bregs percentage within lymphocytes at admission was also a potential predictor of repair at discharge and the following 3 months. Conclusion(s): Bregs and DNTs could be the clinical biomarkers together in the identification of ischemic stroke patients from people with dizziness.Copyright © 2022 Wang, Huang, Li, Lin, Liu, Gao and Zhao.","Authors":"Wang, Y.; Huang, Y.; Li, S.; Lin, J.; Liu, Y.; Gao, Y.; Zhao, J.","Publisher":"Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience","Issue":"Not Available","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2022.1042123","Pages":"1042123","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"regulatory B cells (Bregs) & double negative T cells (DNTs)"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":3947,"Title":"Association Between Novel Pro- and Anti- Inflammatory Adipocytokines in Patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome","Year":2022,"Country":"","Abstract":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Novel pro- and anti-inflammatory adipocytokines affect inflammation, energy metabolism, and insulin signaling.

Iron deficiency, a frequent comorbidity of coronary heart disease, causes an increased expression of transferrin receptor and soluble transferrin receptor levels (sTfR) levels, while iron repletion returns sTfR levels to the normal physiological range. Recently, sTfR levels were proposed as a potential new marker of iron metabolism in cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of circulating sTfR levels in a large cohort of patients with coronary heart disease. Methods and Results The disease cohort comprised 3423 subjects who had angiographically documented coronary heart disease and who participated in the AtheroGene study. Serum levels of sTfR were determined at baseline using an automated immunoassay (Roche Cobas Integra 400). Two main outcomes were considered: a combined end point of myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death and cardiovascular death alone. During a median follow-up of 4.0 years, 10.3% of the patients experienced an end point. In Cox regression analyses for sTfR levels, the hazard ratio (HR) for future cardiovascular death and/or myocardial infarction was 1.27 (95% CI, 1.11-1.44, P<0.001) after adjustment for sex and age. This association remained significant (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.03-1.46, P=0.02) after additional adjustment for body mass index, smoking status, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, C-reactive protein, and surrogates of cardiac function, size of myocardial necrosis (hs-Tnl), and hemoglobin levels. Conclusions In this large cohort study, sTfR levels were strongly associated with future myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death. This implicates a role for sTfR in secondary cardiovascular risk prediction.","Authors":"Weidmann, Henri; Bannasch, Johannes H.; Waldeyer, Christoph; Shrivastava, Apurva; Appelbaum, Sebastian; Ojeda-Echevarria, Francisco Miguel; Schnabel, Renate; Lackner, Karl J.; Blankenberg, Stefan; Zeller, Tanja; Karakas, Mahir","Publisher":"Journal of the American Heart Association","Issue":"9","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.119.015480","Pages":"e015480","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR)"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":3,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":18,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":25,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":31,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":3954,"Title":"Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Electrocardiogram for Atrial Fibrillation Identifies Cognitive Decline Risk and Cerebral Infarcts","Year":2022,"Country":"","Abstract":"Objective: To investigate whether artificial intelligence-enabled electrocardiogram (AI-ECG) assessment of atrial fibrillation (AF) risk predicts cognitive decline and cerebral infarcts. Patients and Methods: This population-based study included sinus-rhythm ECG participants seen from November 29, 2004 through July 13, 2020, and a subset with brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (October 10, 2011, through November 2, 2017). The AI-ECG score of AF risk calculated for participants was 0-1. To determine the AI-ECG-AF relationship with baseline cognitive dysfunction, we compared linear mixed-effects models with global and domain-specific cognitive z-scores from longitudinal neuropsychological assessments. The AI-ECG-AF score was logit transformed and modeled with cubic splines. For the brain-MRI subset, logistic regression evaluated correlation of the AI-ECG-AF score and the high-threshold, dichotomized AI-ECG-AF score with infarcts. Result(s): Participants (N=3729; median age, 74.1 years) underwent cognitive analysis. Adjusting for age, sex, education, and APOE e4-carrier status, the AI-ECG-AF score correlated with lower baseline and faster decline in global-cognitive z-scores (P=.009 and P=.01, respectively, non-linear-based spline-models tests) and attention z-scores (P<.001 and P=.01, respectively). Sinus-rhythm-ECG participants (n=1373) underwent MRI. As a continuous measure, the AI-ECG-AF score correlated with infarcts but not after age and sex adjustment (P=.52). For dichotomized analysis, an AI-ECG-AF score greater than 0.5 correlated with infarcts (OR, 4.61; 95% CI, 2.45-8.55; P<.001); even after age and sex adjustment (OR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.06-4.07; P=.03). Conclusion(s): The AI-ECG-AF score correlated with worse baseline cognition and gradual global cognition and attention decline. High AF probability by AI-ECG-AF score correlated with MRI cerebral infarcts. However, most infarcts observed in our cohort were subcortical, suggesting that AI-ECG not only predicts AF but also detects other non-AF cardiac disease markers and correlates with small vessel cerebrovascular disease and cognitive decline.Copyright © 2022 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research","Authors":"Weil, E.

We studied the effect of baseline NT-proBNP on the primary outcome of AF recurrence > 3 months post-ablation., RESULTS: Of the 173 patients, 88 were randomized to the aggressive cohort, and 85 into the standard group. The primary outcome occurred in 61.4% of those in the aggressive arm, versus 61.2% in the standard arm. In the aggressive group, logNT-proBNP predicted recurrence (HR 1.28, p = 0.04, adjusted HR 1.43, p = 0.03), while in the standard cohort, it did not (HR 0.94, p = 0.62, adjusted HR 0.83, p = 0.22).

Many algorithms have been developed to detect AF in surface electrocardiograms (ECGs) during the past few years. The aim of this systematic review is to gain more insight into these available classification methods by discussing previously used digital biomarkers and algorithms and make recommendations for future research. Method(s): On the 14th of September 2020, the PubMed database was searched for articles focusing on algorithms for AF detection in ECGs using the MeSH terms Atrial Fibrillation, Electrocardiography and Algorithms. Articles which solely focused on differentiation of types of rhythm disorders or prediction of AF termination were excluded. Result(s): The search resulted in 451 articles, of which 130 remained after full-text screening. Not only did the amount of research on methods for AF detection increase over the past years, but a trend towards more complex classification methods is observed. Furthermore, three different types of features can be distinguished: atrial features, ventricular features, and signal features. Although AF is an atrial disease, only 22% of the described methods use atrial features. Conclusion(s): More and more studies focus on improving accuracy of classification methods for AF in ECGs. As a result, algorithms become increasingly complex and less well interpretable. Only a few studies focus on detecting atrial activity in the ECG. Developing innovative methods focusing on detection of atrial activity might provide accurate classifiers without compromising on transparency.Copyright © 2021 The Authors","Authors":"Wesselius, F.

Less is known about whether the increased risk persists long-term or is independent of renal function and other important biomarkers. Methods and Results Cystatin C and other biomarkers were measured at baseline (in 7863 patients) and 1 year later (in 6106 patients) in participants in the LIPID (Long-Term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischemic Disease) study, who had a previous acute coronary syndrome. Outcomes were ascertained during the study (median follow-up, 6 years) and long-term (median follow-up, 16 years). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated using Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equations (first GFR-creatinine, then GFR-creatinine-cystatin C). Over 6 years, in fully adjusted multivariable time-to-event models, with respect to the primary end point of coronary heart disease mortality or nonfatal myocardial infarction, for comparison of Quartile 4 versus 1 of baseline cystatin C, the hazard ratio was 1.37 (95% CI, 1.07-1.74; P=0.01), and for major cardiovascular events was 1.47 (95% CI, 1.19-1.82; P<0.001). Over 16 years, the association of baseline cystatin C with coronary heart disease, cardiovascular, and all-cause mortality persisted (each P<0.001) and remained significant after adjustment for estimated GFR-creatinine-cystatin C. Cystatin C also predicted the development of chronic kidney disease for 6 years (odds ratio, 6.61; 95% CI, 4.28-10.20) independently of estimated GFR-creatinine and other risk factors. However, this association was no longer significant after adjustment for estimated GFR-creatinine-cystatin C. Conclusions Cystatin C independently predicted major cardiovascular events, development of chronic kidney disease, and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Prediction of long-term mortality was independent of improved estimation of GFR.

The primary outcome was a combined CVD end point defined as myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization procedures, or fatal CVD.

Over an average follow-up of 3.7 years, 12 038 patients developed the combined CVD end point. Across all interventions, each 10 mum/y reduction of cIMT progression resulted in a relative risk for CVD of 0.91 (95% Credible Interval, 0.87-0.94), with an additional relative risk for CVD of 0.92 (0.87-0.97) being achieved independent of cIMT progression. Taken together, we estimated that interventions reducing cIMT progression by 10, 20, 30, or 40 mum/y would yield relative risks of 0.84 (0.75-0.93), 0.76 (0.67-0.85), 0.69 (0.59-0.79), or 0.63 (0.52-0.74), respectively.

This study was performed to determine the association between APOE polymorphisms and T2DM with and without CAD, and its effect on plasma lipid levels in a Chinese population., Methods: A total of 1,414 subjects involving 869 patients and 545 health individuals were recruited. These patients were categorized into three distinct groups: 264 in T2DM group, 401 in CAD group, and 204 in T2DM+CAD group. Logistic regression analysis was used to obtain odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) in predicting the risk probability of APOE. Besides, a meta-analysis was preformed to integrate an evaluation index to evaluate their associations., Results: Genotype frequency ratio of genotype E3/4 and allele E4 among the CAD patients with or without T2DM was obviously increased. Compared with E3/3 genotype, the E3/4 genotype had a significant increased risk of CAD (adjusted OR = 1.90, 95% CI = 1.30-2.77) and T2DM+CAD (adjusted OR = 1.95, 95% CI = 1.24-3.08). In the meta-analysis, four studies were included and provided a strong evidence for the APOE E4 mutation elevating the risk of CAD in patients with T2DM (E3/E4+E4/E4 vs. E3/E3, OR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.13-2.02). In the T2DM group, the plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) showed significant difference among the three APOE isoforms. The high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels of CAD patients with E4-bearing genotypes were lower than those with E3/3 genotype., Conclusions: Our results indicate that APOE gene polymorphisms are related to CAD with or without T2DM and have influence on lipid profiles in both T2DM and CAD patients.

Previous studies have analyzed the hemodynamic changes of the ophthalmic artery (OA) in patients with diabetes and ischemic heart disease, but the results remain controversial due to limited observation methods. We aimed to explore the morphological and hemodynamic features in the OA in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) with and without acute coronary syndrome (ACS)., METHODS: In total, 134 participants, including 30 control participants, 34 with ACS only, 34 with T2D only, and 36 with both ACS and T2D, undergoing computed tomography angiography were enrolled. Three-dimensional OA models were reconstructed, and morphological parameters of the OA were measured. In addition, numerical simulations using computational fluid dynamics were used to acquire hemodynamic parameters of the OA., RESULTS: In this study, 134 OA models were reconstructed. Morphological measurements revealed a smaller initial OA diameter in the T2D group than in the other two ACS groups. A hemodynamic simulation showed a significantly lower OA blood velocity in patients with ACS and T2D than that in controls (P < 0.001). The mass flow ratios in all disease groups were lower than those in the control group (P < 0.001, P = 0.020, and P < 0.001, respectively). The ACS and T2D groups had higher OA pressure levels than those of the control group (P = 0.013). The OA blood velocity and mass flow ratio were correlated with several clinical parameters., CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed morphological and hemodynamic differences in the OA between patients with T2D with and without ACS. Furthermore, the hemodynamic characteristics of the OA correlated with clinical prognostic biomarkers, suggesting the potential predictive ability of the OA. Copyright © 2022.

Objective(s): To investigate the correlations of serum levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), MMP-3, and MMP-9 with CAA-related MRI markers, ICH recurrence, and cognitive status. Method(s): 68 cases with first probable CAA-ICH and 69 controls were recruited. Clinical and imaging data were obtained at baseline and serum MMPs in the acute phase were measured by Luminex multiplex assays. Cognitive status was assessed with the Chinese version of Mini-Mental State Examination within 10-14 days after ICH onset. Result(s): Serum MMP-2 level was significantly lower in CAA-ICH patients than controls while MMP-9 was significantly higher. In CAA-ICH patients, MMP-3 level was significantly associated with lobar cerebral microbleeds count after adjusting age, sex, and hypertension (adjusted coefficient 0.368, 95%CI 0.099-0.637, p=0.008).

Studies have implicated the role of FGF21 signaling in the pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). We will investigate the association of FGF21 and AAA development. Material(s) and Method(s): In this study, we assayed plasma levels of FGF21 in 82 patients with AAA and 44 control subjects, then analyzed their relationship with clinical, biochemical and histological phenotypes. The expression of beta-klotho, an essential co-receptor of FGF21, was assessed with IHC staining and RT-qPCR. Machine learning models incorporate a combination of FGF21 and clinical data were utilized in the prediction of AAA occurrence. Key Findings: FGF21 was statistically higher in patients with AAA (781 pg/ml [533, 1213]) than in control subjects (567 pg/ml [324, 939]). After adjustment for age and BMI, we found a positive association of FGF21 levels with AAA diameters, hypertension rate and hsCRP, and a negative correlation between FGF21 levels and HDL-c. Furthermore, the protein levels of beta-klotho in abdominal aorta of AAA were found significantly lower than in control group indicating the presence of FGF21 resistance. Combining FGF21 levels with four clinical characteristics significantly improved the stratification of AAA and control groups with an AUC of 0.778. Significance: Combining detection of plasma FGF21 and clinical characteristics may be reliable for identifying the presence of AAA. The role of FGF21 as a therapeutic target of AAA warrants further investigation.Copyright © 2021","Authors":"Xie, T.; Yin, L.; Guo, D.; Zhang, Z.; Chen, Y.; Liu, B.; Wang, W.; Zheng, Y.","Publisher":"Life Sciences","Issue":"Not Available","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2021.119346","Pages":"119346","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) protein and mRNA expression"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":4061,"Title":"Quantitative proteomics reveal three potential biomarkers for risk assessment of acute myocardial infarction","Year":2022,"Country":"","Abstract":"Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is the one of the main cause of death worldwide.

By bioinformatics analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to validate the candidate proteins. Compared to healthy control plasma exosome, we totally identified 72 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in AMI patients. Also, we found that complement and coagulation cascades was activated by KEGG analysis and GSEA. PLG, C8B and F2 were selected as candidate molecules for further study, and then validated another 40 plasma samples using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Finally, we found that the expression levels of these three proteins (PLG, C8B and F2) were significantly higher than those of healthy controls (P < 0.05).

However, whether the two diseases share a genetic basis and whether the relationship is causal remain unclear. It is also unclear as to whether these relationships differ between ethnic groups., METHODS: By leveraging large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics of T2D (European-based: Ncase = 21,926, Ncontrol = 342,747; East Asian-based: Ncase = 36,614, Ncontrol = 155,150) and PAD (European-based: Ncase = 5673, Ncontrol = 359,551; East Asian-based: Ncase = 3593, Ncontrol = 208,860), we explored the genetic correlation and putative causal relationship between T2D and PAD in both Europeans and East Asians using linkage disequilibrium score regression and seven Mendelian randomization (MR) models. We also performed multi-trait analysis of GWAS and two gene-based analyses to reveal candidate variants and risk genes involved in the shared genetic basis between T2D and PAD., RESULTS: We observed a strong genetic correlation (rg) between T2D and PAD in both Europeans (rg = 0.51; p-value = 9.34 x 10-15) and East Asians (rg = 0.46; p-value = 1.67 x 10-12). The MR analyses provided consistent evidence for a causal effect of T2D on PAD in both ethnicities (odds ratio [OR] = 1.05 to 1.28 for Europeans and 1.15 to 1.27 for East Asians) but not PAD on T2D. This putative causal effect was not influenced by total cholesterol, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, or smoking initiation according to multivariable MR analysis, and the genetic overlap between T2D and PAD was further explored employing an independent European sample through polygenic risk score regression. Multi-trait analysis of GWAS revealed two novel European-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs927742 and rs1734409) associated with the shared genetic basis of T2D and PAD. Gene-based analyses consistently identified one gene ANKFY1 and gene-gene interactions (e.g., STARD10 [European-specific] to AP3S2 [East Asian-specific]; KCNJ11 [European-specific] to KCNQ1 [East Asian-specific]) associated with the trans-ethnic genetic overlap between T2D and PAD, reflecting a common genetic basis for the co-occurrence of T2D and PAD in both Europeans and East Asians., CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides the first evidence for a genetically causal effect of T2D on PAD in both Europeans and East Asians. Several candidate variants and risk genes were identified as being associated with this genetic overlap. Our findings emphasize the importance of monitoring PAD status in T2D patients and suggest new genetic biomarkers for screening PAD risk among patients with T2D. Copyright © 2022.

Current clinical methods remain subject to potential high-risk, nonreproducibility and time-consumption issues. In this study, a deep spatiotemporal adversarial network (DSTGAN) is proposed as a contrast-free, stable and automatic clinical tool to simultaneously segment and quantify MIs directly from the cine MR image. The DSTGAN is implemented using a conditional generative model, which conditions the distributions of the objective cine MR image to directly optimize the generalized error of the mapping between the input and the output. The method consists of the following: (1) A multi-level and multi-scale spatiotemporal variation encoder learns a coarse to fine hierarchical feature to effectively encode the MI-specific morphological and kinematic abnormality structures, which vary for different spatial locations and time periods. (2) The top-down and cross-task generators learn the shared representations between segmentation and quantification to use the commonalities and differences between the two related tasks and enhance the generator preference. (3) Three inter-/intra-tasks to label the relatedness discriminators are iteratively imposed on the encoder and generator to detect and correct the inconsistencies in the label relatedness between and within tasks via adversarial learning. Our proposed method yields a pixel classification accuracy of 96.98%, and the mean absolute error of the MI centroid is 0.96 mm from 165 clinical subjects. These results indicate the potential of our proposed method in aiding standardized MI assessments.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Authors":"Xu, C.; Howey, J.; Ohorodnyk, P.; Roth, M.; Zhang, H.; Li, S.","Publisher":"Medical Image Analysis","Issue":"Not Available","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2019.101568","Pages":"101568","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"model using deep spatiotemporal adversarial network (DSTGAN)"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":3,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":19,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":18,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":24,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":4078,"Title":"The predictive values of different small vessel disease scores on clinical outcomes in mild ICH patients","Year":2021,"Country":"","Abstract":"Aim: To explore the predictive values of different small vessel disease (SVD) scores on functional recoveries and the clinical cerebrovascular events in mild intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Method(s): In this study, we enrolled conscious and mild ICH patients without surgery and further divided them into the cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA)-ICH group and hypertension (HTN)-ICH group. The severity of individual SVD markers, including lacunes, cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS), white matter hyperintensity (WMH), and cortical superficial siderosis (cSS), was evaluated. The original SVD score, modified SVD score, refined SVD score, and CAA-SVD score and the total number of SVD markers were further calculated. Functional recoveries were evaluated using the modified Rankin scale. Recurrences of stroke were defined as readmission to the hospital with a definite diagnosis of stroke. Result(s): A total of 163 ICH patients (60 CAA-ICH and 103 HTN-ICH) were included in the study. The CAA-SVD score (OR=3.429; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.518-7.748) had the best predictive effect on functional dependence in the CAA-ICH group, among which cSS severities probably played a vital role (OR =4.665; 95% CI=1.388-15.679). The total number of SVD markers [hazard ratio (HR)=3.765; 95% CI=1.467-9.663] can better identify stroke recurrences in CAA-ICH. In HTN-ICH, while the total number of SVD markers (HR=2.136; 95% CI=1.218-3.745) also demonstrated association with recurrent stroke, this effect seems to be related with the influence of lacunes (HR=5.064; 95% CI=1.697-15.116). Conclusion(s): The CAA-SVD score and the total number of SVD markers might identify mild CAA-ICH patients with poor prognosis.

Quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure the expression of miR-137 in serum. Logistic analysis was used to evaluate the risk factors for the occurrence of cerebral AS, and receiver operating characteristic curves were used to estimate the diagnostic value of miR-137 and other risk factors for AS occurrence. Furthermore, the prognostic value of miR-137 for patients with AS was estimated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression analysis. The results indicated that serum miR-137 levels were decreased in patients with cerebral AS. The expression of miR-137 was negatively correlated with total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in patients with cerebral AS. The levels of miR-137, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and hypersensitivity C response protein may serve as risk factors for the occurrence of cerebral AS, and miR-137 had diagnostic value for AS screening. Cerebral AS patients with positive cerebrovascular events have low miR-137 expression.

Prior studies have documented elevated AF recurrence rates among females vs. males. Sex-specific mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are poorly understood. This prospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the sex-based differences in cardiac phenotype and their influence on (AF) recurrence following first-time PVI. Method(s): A total of 204 consecutive patients referred for first-time PVI and 101 healthy subjects were prospectively studied by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. Multi-chamber volumetric and functional measures were assessed by sex-corrected Z-score analyses vs. healthy subjects. Patients were followed for a median of 2.6 years for the primary outcome of clinical AF recurrence. Multivariable analyses adjusting for age and comorbidities were performed to identify independent predictors of AF recurrence. Result(s): AF recurrence following first PVI occurred in 41% of males and 59% of females (p = 0.03). Females were older with higher prevalence of hypertension and thyroid disorders. Z-score-based analyses revealed significantly reduced ventricular volumes, greater left atrial (LA) volumes, and reduced LA contractility in females vs. males. Multivariable analysis revealed each of LA minimum and pre-systolic volumes and booster EF Z-scores to be independently associated with AF recurrence, providing respective hazard ratios of 1.10, 1.19, and 0.89 (p = 0.001, 0.03, and 0.01). Conclusion(s): Among patients referred for first time PVI, females were older and demonstrated significantly poorer LA contractile health vs. males, the latter independently associated with AF recurrence. Assessment of LA contractile health may therefore be of value to identify female patients at elevated risk of AF recurrence. Factors influencing female patient referral for PVI at more advanced stages of atrial disease warrant focused investigation.Copyright © 2022 Yakimenka, Labib, Dykstra, Mikami, Satriano, Flewitt, Feuchter, Rivest, Howarth, Lydell, Quinn, Wilton and White.","Authors":"Yakimenka, A.; Labib, D.; Dykstra, S.; Mikami, Y.; Satriano, A.; Flewitt, J.; Feuchter, P.; Rivest, S.; Howarth, A.

According to our previous review, CTRP9 plays a vital role in the process of cardiovascular diseases, including regulating energy metabolism, modulating vasomotion, protecting endothelial cells, inhibiting platelet activation, inhibiting pathological vascular remodeling, stabilizing atherosclerotic plaques, and protecting the heart. We proposed that CTRP9 could play multiple positive and beneficial roles in vascular lesions in ischemic stroke (IS). Here, we aimed to study the relationship between serum CTRP9 and the etiology, severity, and prognosis of IS patients. Method(s): A total of 302 patients with IS and 173 non-stroke controls were selected from the same hospital, and all patients with IS were followed up 12 months after stroke onset. Stroke etiology was classified according to the Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment classification. Symptomatic severity was determined using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score. The lesion volume of acute cerebral ischemia was measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The unfavorable functional outcome was a combination of death or major disability 12 months after stroke onset. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) and net reclassification improvement (NRI) statistics were applied in the statistical analysis. Result(s): We found that serum CTRP9 levels and the ratios of CTRP9/total cholesterol (TC), CTRP9/triglyceride (TG), CTRP9/low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and CTRP9/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were associated with the presence of IS. Moreover, the serum CTRP9 concentration was positively associated with the severity of IS. Incorporation of CTRP9/LDL-C levels into a fully adjusted model for IS-cardioembolic (CE) improved discrimination and calibration, and significantly improved reclassification. In addition, CTRP9 was a predictor of unfavorable functional outcomes. Conclusion(s): All the findings indicated that serum CTRP9 could be a promising blood-derived biomarker for the early evaluation and prognosis assessment of IS.

Background(s): Although advances in DL have been applied to the interpretation of echocardiograms, such techniques have not been reported for interpretation of color Doppler videos for diagnosing VHDs. Method(s): The authors developed a 3-stage DL framework for automatic screening of echocardiographic videos for mitral stenosis (MS), mitral regurgitation (MR), aortic stenosis (AS), and aortic regurgitation (AR) that classifies echocardiographic views, detects the presence of VHDs, and, when present, quantifies key metrics related to VHD severities. The algorithm was trained (n = 1,335), validated (n = 311), and tested (n = 434) using retrospectively selected studies from 5 hospitals. A prospectively collected set of 1,374 consecutive echocardiograms served as a real-world test data set. Result(s): Disease classification accuracy was high, with areas under the curve of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.97-0.99) for MS; 0.88 (95% CI: 0.86-0.90) for MR; 0.97 (95% CI: 0.95-0.99) for AS; and 0.90 (95% CI: 0.88-0.92) for AR in the prospective test data set. The limits of agreement (LOA) between the DL algorithm and physician estimates of metrics of valve lesion severities compared to the LOAs between 2 experienced physicians spanned from -0.60 to 0.77 cm2 vs -0.48 to 0.44 cm2 for MV area; from -0.27 to 0.25 vs -0.23 to 0.08 for MR jet area/left atrial area; from -0.86 to 0.52 m/s vs -0.48 to 0.54 m/s for peak aortic valve blood flow velocity (Vmax); from -10.6 to 9.5 mm Hg vs -10.2 to 4.9 mm Hg for average peak aortic valve gradient; and from -0.39 to 0.32 vs -0.31 to 0.32 for AR jet width/left ventricular outflow tract diameter.

The present study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of Lp(a) for long-term RCVEs and each component of it in people with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Methods This multicenter, observational and retrospective study enrolled 765 ACS patients at 11 hospitals in Chengdu from January 2014 to June 2019. Patients were assigned to low-Lp(a) group [Lp(a) < 30 mg/dl] and high-Lp(a) group [Lp(a) >= 30 mg/dl]. The primary and secondary endpoints were defined as RCVEs and their elements, including all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke and unplanned revascularization. Results Over a median 17-month follow-up, 113 (14.8%) patients presented with RCVEs were reported, among which we observed 57 (7.5%) all-cause deaths, 22 (2.9%) cases of nonfatal stroke, 13 (1.7%) cases of nonfatal MI and 33 (4.3%) cases of unplanned revascularization. The incidences of RCVEs and revascularization in the high-Lp(a) group were significantly higher than those in the low-Lp(a) group (P < 0.05), whereas rates of all-cause death, nonfatal stroke and nonfatal MI were not statistically different (P > 0.05). Kaplan-Meier analysis also revealed the same trend. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis showed that 1-SD increase of Lp(a) was independently associated with both the primary endpoint event [hazard ratio (HR), 1.285 per 1-SD; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.112-1.484; P < 0.001] and revascularization (HR, 1.588 per 1-SD; 95% CI, 1.305-1.932; P < 0.001), but not with the other secondary events. Conclusion Increased Lp(a) is an independent predictor of RCVEs and unplanned revascularization in patients with ACS.Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

In order to improve the effect of image diagnosis, a new deconvolution network model AD-CNNnet based on deep learning was proposed and used in patient CTP image evaluation. The results showed that the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and feature similarity (FSIM) of the AD-CNNnet method were significantly higher than those of traditional methods, while the normalized mean square error (NMSE) was significantly lower than that of traditional algorithms (P<0.05). 80 cases were positive by CTP-CTA, including 16 cases of hyperacute ischemic stroke and 64 cases of acute ischemic stroke. The diagnostic sensitivity was 93.66%, and the specificity was 96.18%.

Hence, new AAA monitoring devices that are convenient in use and cost are needed. Our hypothesis is that analysis of arterial waveforms, which could be obtained with such a device, can provide information about AAA size. We aim to initially test this hypothesis via tonometric waveforms. We study noninvasive carotid and femoral blood pressure (BP) waveforms and reference image-based maximal aortic diameter measurements from 50 AAA patients as well as the two noninvasive BP waveforms from these patients after endovascular repair (EVAR) and from 50 comparable control patients. We develop linear regression models for predicting the maximal aortic diameter from waveform or non-waveform features. We evaluate the models in out-of-training data in terms of predicting the maximal aortic diameter value and changes induced by EVAR. The best model includes the carotid area ratio (diastolic area divided by systolic area) and normalized carotid-femoral pulse transit time ((age.diastolic BP)/(height/PTT)) as input features with positive model coefficients. This model is explainable based on the early, negative wave reflection in AAA and the Moens-Korteweg equation for relating PTT to vessel diameter. The predicted maximal aortic diameters yield receiver operating characteristic area under the curves of 0.83 +/- 0.04 in classifying AAA versus control patients and 0.72 +/- 0.04 in classifying AAA patients before versus after EVAR. These results are significantly better than a baseline model excluding waveform features as input. Our findings could potentially translate to convenient devices that serve as an adjunct to imaging.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s).","Authors":"Yavarimanesh, M.; Cheng, H. M.; Chen, C. H.; Sung, S.

This method mainly relies on doctors' visual observation. However, due to different levels of doctor's experience, the poor inter-reader agreement may result in errors in the final ASPECTS. The purpose of this work was to propose an automated semi-quantitative method for the diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke based on non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT), to provide a reference for doctors in the diagnosis and evaluation. Method(s): NCCT data from a total of 90 patients were included for auto-ASPECTS training and testing. After preprocessing CT images, the regions of interest (ROI) for ASPECTS were labeled using atlas-based segmentation. The mean difference, mean ratio and brain density shifts (BDS) of the corresponding regions of the contralateral brain were used as the standard for quantitative analysis. The auto-ASPECTS method was developed and validated to predict early ischemic changes whose performance was evaluated by the agreement (accuracy) of predictions and consensus scores of two observers. Result(s): A comparison was made among the results on mean difference, mean ratio, BDS and the combination of multiple parameters as the standard. The result of using BDS alone was relatively better than the result of using any other parameter alone or any combination of multiple parameters, and accuracy in the test set was 0.80. In the test set, accuracy with using different BDS thresholds increased by 6.67% compared with using the consistent BDS threshold. After dichotomy of auto-ASPECTS and consensus scores with the threshold of 7, the agreement of them was 83.3% and there was no significant difference between the two distributions (p = 0.344) in McNemar test.

Method(s): Forty-one patients with suspected CAD underwent within 7 days apart rest-stress cardiac PET with 82Rb and DSE followed by cardiac 18F-FDG PET imaging. 18F-FDG images were scored on a 0 (no discernible uptake) to 2 (intense uptake) scale. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of stress-induced ischemia. The incremental value of 18F-FDG PET over DSE in detecting ischemia at 82Rb PET cardiac imaging was assessed by the likelihood ratio chi-square and net reclassification index. Result(s): On 82Rb-PET imaging, myocardial ischemia (ischemic total perfusion defect >= 5%) was detected in 20 (49%) patients. Inducible ischemia was found in 22 (54%) patients on DSE (biphasic or worsening response pattern in >= 1 segment) and in 21 (51%) patients on 18F-FDG PET (uptake score of 2 in >= 1 segment). 18F-FDG PET resulted as statistically significant predictor of ischemia on 82Rb-PET. The addition of 18F-FDG PET to DSE increased the likelihood of ischemia on 82Rb-PET (P <.05). 18F-FDG PET was able to reclassify the probability of stress-induced myocardial ischemia on both patient and vessel analyses. Conclusion(s): 18F-FDG PET performed after dobutamine stress test may provide incremental value to DSE in the evaluation of myocardial ischemia. These results suggest that stress-induced myocardial ischemia can be imaged directly using 18F-FDG PET after dobutamine stress test.Copyright © 2021, American Society of Nuclear Cardiology.","Authors":"Zampella, E.; Assante, R.; Acampa, W.; Gaudieri, V.; Nappi, C.; Mannarino, T.; D'Antonio, A.; Buongiorno, P.; Panico, M.; Mainolfi, C.

Since the kidney filters FABP3 from circulation, we investigated whether urinary fatty acid binding protein 3 (uFABP3) is associated with PAD, and also explored its potential as a diagnostic biomarker for this disease state. A total of 130 patients were recruited from outpatient clinics at St. Michael's Hospital, comprising of 65 patients with PAD and 65 patients without PAD (non-PAD). Levels of uFABP3 normalized for urine creatinine (uFABP3/uCr) were 1.7-folds higher in patients with PAD [median (IQR) 4.41 (2.79-8.08)] compared with non-PAD controls [median (IQR) 2.49 (1.78-3.12), p-value = 0.001]. Subgroup analysis demonstrated no significant effect of cardiovascular risk factors (age, sex, hypertension, hypercholesteremia, diabetes and smoking) on uFABP3/uCr in both PAD and non-PAD patients. Spearmen correlation studies demonstrated a significant negative correlation between uFABP3/uCr and ABI (rho = - 0.436; p-value = 0.001). Regression analysis demonstrated that uFABP3/Cr levels were associated with PAD independently of age, sex, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, prior history of coronary arterial disease and Estimated Glomerular Filtration rate (eGFR) [odds ratio: 2.34 (95% confidence interval: 1.47-3.75) p-value < 0.001].

Therefore, its diagnosis and treatment require increased attention. Although beta-2 microglobulin (b2-MG) is a novel marker of cardiovascular disease, its role in AF has not been evaluated. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted a case-control study with 61 patients who had normal heart rhythm (control group) and 60 patients with AF (research group). We analyzed the serum b2-MG levels in both groups and performed multivariate analysis to assess the correlation between b2-MG and left atrial remodeling. In addition, b2-MG levels were compared between the left atrial blood and peripheral venous blood of another set of 57 patients with AF, who underwent cryoballoon ablation. RESULTS There were no statistically significant differences in the baseline characteristics (age, sex, history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, previous stroke, coronary heart disease, and estimated glomerular filtration rate) of the control and research groups. The left atrial anteroposterior diameters (LAD) and left ventricular end-systolic diameters in the AF group were significantly larger compared to the control group (P<0.01). Serum s2-MG levels in patients with AF were significantly higher (P<0.01) and positively correlated with the LAD (B-coefficient 25.482, 95% CI 14.410~36.554, P<0.01), serum s2-MG levels in the left atrial blood were significantly higher than those in peripheral venous blood (P<0.01), and serum s2-MG levels were an independent predictor of AF. CONCLUSIONS With the development of atrial fibrillation, the serum s2-MG levels increase and are closely related to the left atrial remodeling due to AF. Therefore, s2-MG can be an effective biomarker for predicting AF.","Authors":"Zhang, Bangying; Chen, Xinpei; Mu, Xiaofeng; Liu, Enzhao; Liu, Tong; Xu, Gang; Bao, Qiankun; Li, Guangping","Publisher":"Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research","Issue":"Not Available","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.12659/MSM.932813","Pages":"e932813","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"serum beta-2 microglobulin"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":3,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":24,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":31,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":37,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":4278,"Title":"A radiomics feature-based machine learning models to detect brainstem infarction (RMEBI) may enable early diagnosis in non-contrast enhanced CT","Year":2023,"Country":"","Abstract":"Objectives: Magnetic resonance imaging has high sensitivity in detecting early brainstem infarction (EBI). However, MRI is not practical for all patients who present with possible stroke and would lead to delayed treatment. The detection rate of EBI on non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) is currently very low. Thus, we aimed to develop and validate the radiomics feature-based machine learning models to detect EBI (RMEBIs) on NCCT. Method(s): In this retrospective observational study, 355 participants from a multicentre multimodal database established by Huashan Hospital were randomly divided into two data sets: a training cohort (70%) and an internal validation cohort (30%). Fifty-seven participants from the Second Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University were included as the external validation cohort. Brainstems were segmented by a radiologist committee on NCCT and 1781 radiomics features were automatically computed. After selecting the relevant features, 7 machine learning models were assessed in the training cohort to predict early brainstem infarction. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, F1-score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the performance of the prediction models. Result(s): The multilayer perceptron (MLP) RMEBI showed the best performance (AUC: 0.99 [95% CI: 0.96-1.00]) in the internal validation cohort. The AUC value in external validation cohort was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.82-0.98). Conclusion(s): RMEBIs have the potential in routine clinical practice to enable accurate computer-assisted diagnoses of early brainstem infarction in patients with NCCT, which may have important clinical value in reducing therapeutic decision-making time. Key Points: * RMEBIs have the potential to enable accurate diagnoses of early brainstem infarction in patients with NCCT. * RMEBIs are suitable for various multidetector CT scanners. * The patient treatment decision-making time is shortened.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to European Society of Radiology.","Authors":"Zhang, H.; Chen, H.; Zhang, C.; Cao, A.; Lu, Q.; Wu, H.; Zhang, J.; Geng, D.","Publisher":"European Radiology","Issue":"2","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00330-022-09130-6","Pages":"1004-1014","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"radiomics feature-based machine learning models to detect early brainstem infarctions (RMEBIs)"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":18,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":4279,"Title":"Prognostic indicators of new onset atrial fibrillation in patients with acute coronary syndrome","Year":2020,"Country":"","Abstract":"BACKGROUND: This study aims to estimate prognostic indicators of new onset atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) through 3 to 5 years of follow-up., HYPOTHESIS: For patients with ACS, some prognostic indicators can be used to predict new onset AF., METHODS: The Improving Care for Cardiovascular Disease in China-ACS (CCC-ACS) program was launched in 2014 by a collaborative initiative of the American Heart Association and Chinese Society of Cardiology.

Cardiac biomarker, ECG, and echocardiography results were examined for correlation with biopsy-proven disease. A prediction model for cardiac amyloidosis was derived using multivariable logistic regression., RESULTS: The overall cohort was characterized by elevated BNP (median 727ng/mL), increased left ventricular wall thickness (IWT; median 1.7cm), and reduced voltage-to-mass ratio (median 0.06mm/[g/m2]).

Despite many therapeutic improvements, in particular timely and successful surgery, in-hospital mortality rates are still higher. Timely identification of patients at high risk will help improve the overall prognosis of AAD. Since early clinical and radiological signs are nonspecific, there is an urgent need for accurate biomarkers. Smooth muscle 22alpha (SM22alpha) is a potential marker for AAD because of its abundant expression in vascular smooth muscle, which is involved in development of AAD. Methods We prepared three different mouse models, including abdominal aortic aneurysm, neointimal hyperplasia and atherosclerosis. SM22alpha levels were assessed in serum and vascular tissue of the mice. Next, the relationships between serum SM22alpha level and vascular lesion were studied in mice. Finally, serum from 41 patients with AAD, 107 carotid artery stenosis (CAS) patients and 40 healthy volunteers were tested for SM22alpha. Serum levels of SM22alpha were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results Compared with the controls, serum SM22alpha levels were reduced in the models of aortic aneurysm, neointimal formation and atherosclerosis, and elevated in mice with ruptured aneurysm. Serum SM22alpha level was negatively correlated with apoptosis rate of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), ratio of intima/ media (I/M) area and plaque size. Patients with AAD had significantly higher serum SM22alpha levels than patients with only CAS, or normal controls. Conclusion Serum SM22alpha could be a potential predictive marker for AAD, and regulation of VSMC is a possible mechanism for the effects of SM22alpha.Copyright: © 2022 Zhang et al.

In the present study, we examined diagnostic and predictive values of circulating H4B levels in human patients of thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) for the first time, while clinically applicable biomarkers for aortic aneurysms have never been previously available. Ninety-five patients scheduled for TAA repair surgeries and 53 control subjects were recruited at University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Ronald Regan Medical Center, while 44 control subjects and 29 AAA patients were recruited through National Institute of Health (NIH) National Disease Research Interchange (NDRI) program. We had intriguing observations that circulating H4B levels were substantially lower in TAA and AAA patients, linearly correlated with aortic H4B levels (blood: R = 0.8071, p < 0.0001, n = 75; plasma: R = 0.7983, p < 0.0001, n = 75), and associated with incidence of TAA (blood: adjusted OR 0.495; 95% CI 0.379-0.647; p < 0.001; plasma: adjusted OR 0.501; 95% CI 0.385-0.652; p < 0.001) or AAA (blood: adjusted OR 0.329; 95% CI 0.125-0.868; p = 0.025) after adjustment for other factors.

This threshold was also significantly associated with incidence of AAA (p < 0.001 by Chi-square analysis). In addition, we observed previously unrecognized inverse association of Statin use with TAA, and an association of AAA with arrhythmia. Taken together, our data strongly demonstrate for the first time that circulating H4B levels can serve as a first-in-class, sensitive, robust and independent biomarker for clinical diagnosis and prediction of TAA and AAA in human patients, which can be rapidly translated to bedside to fundamentally improve clinical management of the devastating human disease of aortic aneurysms.Copyright © 2022","Authors":"Zhang, Y.; Siu, K.

Method(s): This study included 296 patients (128 cases of ischemic stroke and 168 cases in the normal control group). The basic data of the patients were collected. Color fundus photography was performed after pupil dilation, and the retinal vascular caliber was measured using semiautomated vascular measurement software (IVAN Software, Sydney, Australia). The severity of white matter lesions (WML) on cranial nuclear magnetic fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images were assessed using the Fazekas scale. Moreover, logistic regression analysis was used to establish different risk assessment models for ischemic stroke. The effects of models were evaluated through the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the Delong test compared area under the curve. Result(s): The sensitivity and specificity of models 1 (the traditional risk factor model), 2 (the retinal vascular caliber model), 3 (the WML model), and 4 (the combined the traditional risk factor, WML and central retinal artery equivalent (CRAE) model) were 71 and 55%, 48 and 71%, 49 and 67%, and 68 and 68.5% with areas under the curve of 0.658, 0.586, 0.601, and 0.708, respectively.

Moreover, no statistical significance exists in the pairwise comparison of other models. Conclusion(s): The risk assessment model of ischemic stroke combined with Fazekas grade of WML and CRAE is superior to the traditional risk factor and the single-index model. This model is helpful for risk stratification of high-risk stroke patients.© Copyright © 2021 Zhao, Jiang, Li, Yang, Cheng, Hong and Wang.","Authors":"Zhao, L.; Jiang, B.; Li, H.; Yang, X.; Cheng, X.; Hong, H.; Wang, Y.","Publisher":"Frontiers in Neurology","Issue":"Not Available","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2021.696986","Pages":"696986","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"white matter lesions (WML) & retinal vascular caliber & risk assessment model combined with Fazekas grade of WML and central retinal artery equivalent (CRAE)"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":3,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":24,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":37,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":4351,"Title":"Multimodal Retinal Imaging for Detection of Ischemic Stroke","Year":2021,"Country":"","Abstract":"Background: This study aims to evaluate ocular changes in patients with ischemic stroke using multimodal imaging and explore the predictive value of ocular abnormalities for ischemic stroke.

Myocardial stretch is the main factor to stimulate NT Pro-BNP secretion in cardiomyocytes. NT Pro-BNP is an important risk factor for cardiac dysfunction, stroke, and pulmonary embolism. So does atrial myocyte stretching occur when patients have atrial fibrillation (AF)? Whether atrial muscle stretch induced by AF leads to increased NT Pro-BNP remains unclear. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between NT Pro-BNP and AF., HYPOTHESIS: AF can cause changes in myocardial tension. Changes in myocardial tension may lead to increased secretion of NT Pro-BNP. We hypothesize that NT Pro-BNP may increase in AF with or without LAD enlargement., METHODS: This clinical study is an observational study and has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University. Ethical approval documents is attached. The study retrospectively reviewed 1345 patients with and without AF. After excluding 102 patients who were not eligible, the final total sample size was 1243 cases: AF group 679 patients (378, 55.7% males) and non-AF group 564 patients (287, 50.8% males). NT Pro-BNP was observed in AF group and non-AF group with or without LAD. After adjusting for age, gender, BMI, left atrial diameter, hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, and cerebral infarction, NT Pro-BNP remains statistically significant with AF., CONCLUSION: NT Pro-BNP can be used as a risk predictor of AF with or without left atrial enlargement.

It is reported to be closely associated with the occurrence of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). However, the mechanism of acylcarnitine affecting myocardial disorders is yet to be explored. This current research explores the different chain lengths of acylcarnitines as biomarkers for the early diagnosis of DCM and the mechanism of acylcarnitines for the development of DCM in-vitro., METHODS: In a retrospective non-interventional study, 50 simple type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and 50 DCM patients were recruited. Plasma samples from both groups were analyzed by high throughput metabolomics and cluster heat map using mass spectrometry. Principal component analysis was used to compare the changes occurring in the studied 25 acylcarnitines. Multivariable binary logistic regression was used to analyze the odds ratio of each group for factors and the 95% confidence interval in DCM. Myristoylcarnitine (C14) exogenous intervention was given to H9c2 cells to verify the expression of lipid metabolism-related protein, inflammation-related protein expression, apoptosis-related protein expression, and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and fibrosis-related protein expression., RESULTS: Factor 1 (C14, lauroylcarnitine, tetradecanoyldiacylcarnitine, 3-hydroxyl-tetradecanoylcarnitine, arachidic carnitine, octadecanoylcarnitine, 3-hydroxypalmitoleylcarnitine) and factor 4 (octanoylcarnitine, hexanoylcarnitine, decanoylcarnitine) were positively correlated with the risk of DCM. Exogenous C14 supplementation to cardiomyocytes led to increased lipid deposition in cardiomyocytes along with the obstacles in adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathways and affecting fatty acid oxidation. This further caused myocardial lipotoxicity, ultimately leading to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, fibrotic remodeling, and increased apoptosis. However, this effect was mitigated by the AMPK agonist acadesine., CONCLUSIONS: The increased plasma levels in medium and long-chain acylcarnitine extracted from factors 1 and 4 are closely related to the risk of DCM, indicating that these factors can be an important tool for DCM risk assessment. C14 supplementation associated lipid accumulation by inhibiting the AMPK/ACC/CPT1 signaling pathway, aggravated myocardial lipotoxicity, increased apoptosis apart from cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and fibrosis were alleviated by the acadesine.

Therefore, we aimed to validate the findings of prior studies. Method(s): A single-center prospective cohort study that recruited patients with (1) recent TIA or ischemic stroke within the past 30 days, (2) ipsilateral carotid artery stenosis of >=50%, and (3) were not considered for early carotid revascularization. The (1) maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of the symptomatic carotid plaque, (2) the SCAIL score, and (3) stenosis severity of the symptomatic carotid artery were measured for all patients. The outcomes were (1) a 90-day ipsilateral ischemic stroke and (2) a 90-day ipsilateral symptomatic TIA or major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE). Result(s): Among the 131 patients included in the study, the commonest cardiovascular risk factor was hypertension (95 patients, 72.5%), followed by diabetes mellitus (77 patients, 58.8%) and being a current smoker (64 patients, 48.9%). The median (IQR) duration between the index cerebral ischemic event and recruitment to the study was 1 (0, 2.5) days. The median (IQR) duration between the index cerebral ischemic event and FDG-PET was 5 (4, 7) days. A total of 14 (10.7%) patients had a 90-day stroke, and 41 (31.3%) patients had a 90-day TIA or MACE. On comparison of the predictive performances of the SCAIL score and SUVmax, SUVmax was found to be superior to the SCAIL score for predicting both 90-day ipsilateral ischemic stroke (AUC: SCAIL = 0.79, SUVmax = 0.92; p < 0.001; 95% CI = 0.072, 0.229) and 90-day TIA or MACE (AUC: SCAIL = 0.76, SUVmax = 0.84; p = 0.009; 95% CI = 0.020, 0.143). Conclusion(s): Plaque inflammation as quantified on FDG-PET may serve as a reliable biomarker for risk stratification among patients with ECAD and recent TIA or ischemic stroke.

METHODS We conducted a single-center, nested case-control study using the emergency chest pain cohort of Peking University Third Hospital. Untargeted lipidomics were conducted while LASSO regression as well as XGBoost combined with greedy algorithm were used to select lipid molecules. RESULTS Fifty-two STEMI patients along with 52 controls were enrolled. A total of 1925 lipid molecules were detected. There were 93 lipid molecules in the positive ion mode which were differentially expressed between the STEMI and the control group, while in the negative ion mode, there were 73 differentially expressed lipid molecules. In the positive ion mode, the differentially expressed lipid subclasses were mainly diacylglycerol (DG), lysophophatidylcholine (LPC), acylcarnitine (CAR), lysophosphatidyl ethanolamine (LPE), and phosphatidylcholine (PC), while in the negative ion mode, significantly expressed lipid subclasses were mainly free fatty acid (FA), LPE, PC, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylinositol (PI). LASSO regression selected 22 lipids while XGBoost combined with greedy algorithm selected 10 lipids. PC (15: 0/18: 2), PI (19: 4), and LPI (20: 3) were the overlapping lipid molecules selected by the two feature screening methods. Logistic model established using the three lipids had excellent performance in discrimination and calibration both in the derivation set (AUC: 0.972) and an internal validation set (AUC: 0.967). In 19 STEMI patients with normal cardiac troponin, 18 patients were correctly diagnosed using lipid model. CONCLUSIONS The differentially expressed lipids were mainly DG, CAR, LPC, LPE, PC, PI, PE, and FA. Using lipid molecules selected by XGBoost combined with greedy algorithm and LASSO regression to establish model could accurately predict STEMI even in the more earlier stage.Copyright © 2022 JGC All rights reserved.","Authors":"Zhi, S.; Yang, L.; Yuan, Y.

It has also been found to play an important role in several diseases, such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Both abnormalities in ANP and associated medical history are involved in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation (AF). However, plasma concentration of musclin as a biomarker for risk stratification in patients with AF has not been fully investigated. Method(s): Plasma musclin levels were measured in 290 patients with AF (including 199 paroxysmal AF patients and 91 persistent AF patients) and 120 control subjects. The association between plasma musclin levels and AF onset, as well as its predictive effects on clinical outcomes after cryoballoon ablation were analyzed. Result(s): AF patients were found to have a lower concentration of plasma musclin than healthy controls. Moreover, in the non-diabetic group and normal N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level group, the association between lower plasma concentration of musclin and AF remained significant. According to receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, the optimal cut-off point of musclin for predicting AF onset was 54.94 ng/mL, which had a sensitivity of 81.67% and a specificity of 31.47% [area under the ROC curve (AUC) =60.71%]. In follow-up studies, both diabetes and left atrial size were independent predictors of AF recurrence after ablation, while musclin showed only a modest relationship with the outcome of cryoballoon ablation. Conclusion(s): Our data indicated that decreased musclin was associated with the onset of AF. Moreover, lower plasma levels of musclin were an independent risk factor of AF in non-diabetic patients. Our studies suggest that musclin could be a predictive factor for the onset of AF.Copyright © Annals of Translational Medicine.

Its implication in risk assessment and prevention of the first stroke remains an important clinical and public health question. Method(s): This study was based on a community cohort recruited from 2016 to 2018 in the rural China. To maximize cost efficiency, we used a nested case-control design, including 3,533 first stroke cases and 3,533 controls matched for age +/-1 years, sex, and village. Individual associations of tHcy and traditional risk factors with the first stroke were examined, and their population-attributable risks (PARs) were estimated. Result(s): There was a significant dose-response association between first stroke and total Hcy (tHcy) levels, with adjusted odds ratios of 1.11 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.26) for tHcy 10-15 mumol/L and 1.44 (1.22, 1.69) for tHcy >= 15 mumol/L, all compared to tHcy < 10 mumol/L. A similar trend was found for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. tHcy and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were independently and additively associated with the risk of first stroke (tHcy: 1.06 [1.02, 1.1]; SBP: 1.13 [1.1, 1.16]; P-interaction, 0.889). Among the ten main risk factors examined, the top two contributors to the first stroke were SBP and tHcy, with PARs of 25.73 and 11.24%, respectively. Conclusion(s): Elevated tHcy is the second most important contributor and acts additively with SBP to increase the risk of the first stroke. This finding underscores the importance of screening and treating elevated tHcy along with traditional risk factors to further reduce the burden of the first stroke in the high-risk populations.Copyright © 2022 Zhou, Liu, Ye, Wang, Shao, Zhang, Duan, Chen, Kuang, Li, Song, Liu, Zalloua, Wang, Xu and Zhang.","Authors":"Zhou, F.; Liu, C.; Ye, L.; Wang, Y.; Shao, Y.; Zhang, G.; Duan, Z.; Chen, J.; Kuang, J.; Li, J.; Song, Y.; Liu, L.; Zalloua, P.; Wang, X.; Xu, X.; Zhang, C.","Publisher":"Frontiers in Medicine","Issue":"Not Available","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.727418","Pages":"727418","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"homocysteine (Hcy)"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":18,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":4398,"Title":"Serum miR-222 is independently associated with atrial fibrillation in patients with degenerative valvular heart disease","Year":2021,"Country":"","Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Inflammation is involved in the progression of degenerative valvular heart disease (DVHD). microRNA-222 (miR-222) contributes to inflammation-mediated vascular remodeling, but its involvement in DVHD in relation to atrial fibrillation (AF) is unknown.

Background(s): Patients with CMD have poorer prognosis with various cardiac diseases. The myocardial perfusion reserve index (MPRI) derived from noninvasive stress perfusion CMR has been established to diagnose microvascular angina with a threshold MPRI <1.4. The prognosis of CMD as determined by MPRI is unknown. Method(s): Chest pain patients without epicardial CAD or myocardial disease from January 2009 to December 2017 were retrospectively included from 3 imaging centers in Hong Kong (HK). Stress perfusion CMR examinations were performed using either adenosine or adenosine triphosphate. Adequate stress was assessed by achieving splenic switch-off sign. Measurement of MPRI was performed in all stress perfusion CMR scans. Patients were followed for major adverse cardiovascular events defined as all-cause death, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), epicardial CAD development, heart failure hospitalization and non-fatal stroke. Result(s): A total of 218 patients were studied (mean age 59 +/- 12 years; 49.5% male) and the average MPRI of that cohort was 1.56 +/- 0.33. Females and a history of hyperlipidemia were predictors of lower MPRI. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) occurred in 15.6% of patients during a median follow-up of 5.5 years (interquartile range: 4.6 to 6.8 years). The optimal cutoff value of MPRI in predicting MACE was found with a threshold MPRI <=1.47. Patients with MPRI <=1.47 had three-fold increased risk of MACE compared with those with MPRI >1.47 (hazard ratio [HR]: 3.14; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.58 to 6.25; p = 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression after adjusting for age and hypertension demonstrated that MPRI was an independent predictor of MACE (HR: 0.10; 95% CI: 0.03 to 0.34; p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Stress perfusion CMR-derived MPRI is an independent imaging marker that predicts MACE in patients with ischemic symptom and no overt CAD over the medium term.Copyright © 2021 The Authors","Authors":"Zhou, W.; Lee, J.

Recent studies demonstrated that epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) was closely associated with AF in general population. However, the relationship between EAT and AF in HCM patients remains unclear. A total of 93 consecutive patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) at Fuwai Hospital were enrolled in our study. There were 18 patients with AF and 75 patients without it. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging was performed in all participants. EAT volume (EATV) and left atrial volume (LAV) were determined by E-3D medical model software. HOCM patients with AF had significantly greater EATV index (EATVI, P < 0.001), LAV index (LAVI, P < 0.001) and left ventricular end-systole volume index (LVESVI, P = 0.039), and lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF, P = 0.002). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, EATVI, LAVI, and LVEF remained independent determinants of AF occurrence (OR = 1.023, 95% CI, 1.003-1.043, P = 0.023, OR = 1.043, 95% CI, 1.012-1.075, P = 0.006, and OR = 0.887, 95% CI, 0.818-0.962, P = 0.004, respectively). Furthermore, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated that integration of EATVI, LAVI and LVEF provided better discriminatory performance for incident AF in HOCM patients with a high sensitivity of 94.4% and a specificity of 69.3% (AUC = 0.864, 95% CI, 0.771-0.958, P < 0.001). EATVI is an independent predictor of the presence of AF, and integration of EATVI, LVEF and LAVI determined by CMR provide greater discriminatory performance for identifying AF in HOCM patients.Copyright © 2021, Springer Nature B.V.","Authors":"Zhou, Y.; Yu, M.; Cui, J.; Hu, F.; Yang, Z.; Yuan, J.; Qiao, S.","Publisher":"International Journal of Cardiovascular Imaging","Issue":"4","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10554-020-02092-0","Pages":"1383-1393","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"epicardial adipose tissue index (EATVI) & left atrial volume index (LAVI) & left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":10,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":18,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":24,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":4421,"Title":"Sex Differences in Epicardial Adipose Tissue: Association With Atrial Fibrillation Ablation Outcomes","Year":2022,"Country":"","Abstract":"Background: There are significant differences in the prevalence and prognosis of atrial fibrillation (AF) between sexes. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) has been found as a risk factor for AF. This study aimed to evaluate whether sex-based EAT differences were correlated with AF recurrence and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Method(s): In this study, postmenopausal women and age, BMI, and type of AF matched men who had received first catheter ablation were included. EAT volume was quantified based on the pre-ablation cardiac computed tomography (CT) images. Clinical, CT, and echocardiographic variables were compared by sex groups. The predictors of AF recurrence and MACE were determined through Cox proportional hazards regression. Result(s): Women were found with significantly lower total EAT volumes (P < 0.001) but higher periatrial/total (P/T) EAT ratios (P = 0.009). The median follow-up duration was 444.5 days. As revealed by the result of the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, the women were found to have a significantly higher prevalence of AF recurrence (log rank, P = 0.011) but comparable MACE (log rank, P = 0.507) than men. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that female gender (HR: 1.88 [95% CI: 1.03, 4.15], P = 0.032), persistent AF (HR: 2.46 [95% CI: 1.19, 5.05], P = 0.015), left atrial (LA) dimension (HR: 1.47 [95% CI: 1.02, 2.13], P = 0.041), and P/T EAT ratio (HR: 1.73 [95% CI: 1.12, 2.67], P = 0.013) were found as the independent predictors of AF recurrence. Sex-based subgroup multivariable analysis showed that the P/T EAT ratio was an independent predictor of AF recurrence in both men (HR: 1.13 [95% CI: 1.01, 1.46], P = 0.047) and women (HR: 1.37 [95% CI: 1.11, 1.67], P = 0.028).

In our study, six GWAS-linked hot loci (ALDH2 rs10744777, HDAC9 rs2107595, ABO rs532436, PATJ rs76221407, LOC105372028 rs1842681 and PTCH1 rs2236406) were selected, genotyped and analyzed in 982 IS patients from northern Chinese population, in order to explore their roles in stroke functional outcome and recurrence risk. We found that PTCH1 rs2236406 was significantly associated with functional outcome after stroke. Further logistic regression analysis revealed the variant genotype TC/CC of rs2236406 as an independent prognostic factor for poor stroke recovery in Chinese population. Meanwhile, we observed that GA/AA genotype of ABO rs532436 was statistically correlated with the increased risk of stroke recurrence, especially for patients with large-Artery atherosclerosis. Moreover, multivariate Cox analysis identified ABO rs12342 as an independent predictor for IS recurrence. Further functional annotation analysis demonstrated that rs2236406 and rs2043211 were located in the transcriptionally active region, and could change the regulatory motif, transcription factor binding capacity and expression level of RP11-435O5.5 (antisense to PTCH1) and ABO, respectively. In summary, our results suggested that PTCH1 rs2236406 and ABO rs532436 may be novel genetic markers and potential therapeutic targets for stroke prognosis.

Circulating phylloquinone solely represents phylloquinone (vitamin K1) intake, while dephosphorylated uncarboxylated Matrix Gla Protein (dp-ucMGP) represents both phylloquinone and menaquinone (vitamin K2) intake. This study aims to investigate the causal relationship between genetically predicted vitamin K concentrations and the risk of CHD via a two-sample Mendelian Randomization approach., DESIGN: We used data from three studies: the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-CVD case-cohort study, CARDIOGRAMplusC4D and the UK Biobank, resulting in 103,097 CHD cases. Genetically predicted vitamin K concentrations were measured using SNPs related to circulating phylloquinone and dp-ucMGP. We calculated a genetic risk score (GRS) including four SNPs (rs2108622, rs2192574, rs4645543 and rs6862071) related to circulating phylloquinone levels from a genome wide association study. Rs4236 was used as an instrumental variable for dp-ucMGP. Inverse-variance weighted (IVW) analysis was used to obtain Risk Ratios (RRs) for the causal relationship between phylloquinone and dp-ucMGP concentrations and CHD risk., RESULTS: Using the genetic score for circulating phylloquinone, we found that circulating phylloquinone was not causally related to CHD risk (RR 1.00 (95%-CI: 0.98; 1.04)). Lower genetically predicted dp-ucMGP concentration was associated with a lower CHD risk with a RR of 0.96 (95%-CI: 0.93; 0.99) for every 10 mug/L decrease in dp-ucMGP., CONCLUSIONS: This study did not confirm a causal relationship between circulating phylloquinone and lower CHD risk. However, lower dp-ucMGP levels may be causally related with a decreased CHD risk. This inconsistent result may reflect the influence of menaquinones in the association with CHD.
