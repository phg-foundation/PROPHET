However, a definitive causal relationship between smoking and the risk of SAH has not been established. Using Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses, we tested the hypothesis that smoking is causally linked to the risk of SAH. Method(s): We conducted a 1-sample MR study using data from the UK Biobank, a large cohort study that enrolled over 500 000 Britons aged 40 to 69 from 2006 to 2010. Participants of European descent were included. SAH cases were ascertained using a combination of self-reported, electronic medical record, and death registry data. As the instrument, we built a polygenic risk score using independent genetic variants known to associate (P<5x10-8) with smoking behavior. This polygenic risk score represents the genetic susceptibility to smoking initiation. The primary MR analysis utilized the ratio method. Secondary MR analyses included the inverse variance weighted and weighted median methods. Result(s): A total of 408 609 study participants were evaluated (mean age, 57 [SD 8], female sex, 220 937 [54%]). Among these, 132 566 (32%) ever smoked regularly, and 904 (0.22%) had a SAH. Each additional SD of the smoking polygenic risk score was associated with 21% increased risk of smoking (odds ratio [OR], 1.21 [95% CI, 1.20-1.21]; P<0.001) and a 10% increased risk of SAH (OR, 1.10 [95% CI, 1.03-1.17]; P=0.006). In the primary MR analysis, genetic susceptibility to smoking was associated with a 63% increase in the risk of SAH (OR, 1.63 [95% CI, 1.15-2.31]; P=0.006). Secondary analyses using the inverse variance weighted method (OR, 1.57 [95% CI, 1.13-2.17]; P=0.007) and the weighted median method (OR, 1.74 [95% CI, 1.06-2.86]; P=0.03) yielded similar results. There was no significant pleiotropy (MR-Egger intercept P=0.39; MR Pleiotropy Residual Sum and Outlier global test P=0.69). Conclusion(s): These findings provide evidence for a causal link between smoking and the risk of SAH.Copyright © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.","Authors":"Acosta, J.

We aimed to determine the causal associations between genetically predicted sleep duration and 12 CVDs using both linear and nonlinear Mendelian randomization (MR) designs. Methods and Results: Genetic variants associated with continuous, short (<=6 h) and long (>=9 h) sleep durations were used to examine the causal associations with 12 CVDs among 404 044 UK Biobank participants of White British ancestry. Linear MR analyses showed that genetically predicted sleep duration was negatively associated with arterial hypertension, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary embolism, and chronic ischaemic heart disease after correcting for multiple tests (P < 0.001). Nonlinear MR analyses demonstrated nonlinearity (L-shaped associations) between genetically predicted sleep duration and four CVDs, including arterial hypertension, chronic ischaemic heart disease, coronary artery disease, and myocardial infarction. Complementary analyses provided confirmative evidence of the adverse effects of genetically predicted short sleep duration on the risks of 5 out of the 12 CVDs, including arterial hypertension, pulmonary embolism, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and chronic ischaemic heart disease (P < 0.001), and suggestive evidence for atrial fibrillation (P < 0.05). However, genetically predicted long sleep duration was not associated with any CVD. Conclusion(s): This study suggests that genetically predicted short sleep duration is a potential causal risk factor of several CVDs, while genetically predicted long sleep duration is unlikely to be a causal risk factor for most CVDs.Copyright © 2021 Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

However, CAC scoring may improve risk classification and prediction of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events beyond risk scores in asymptomatic individuals with prediabetes and diabetes, warranting CAC assessment in this population. The routine availability through provision of no-charge CAC as an alternative to routine probabilistic risk scores may improve utilization of preventive therapies especially in traditionally underserved populations., METHODS: Prospective observational study in a large health system offering no-charge CAC scoring for primary prevention risk prediction with available glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) measurements between June 2015 and March 2019 were divided according to no diabetes (HbA1c <5.7%), prediabetes (HbA1c 5.7%-6.4%), or diabetes (HbA1c>=6.5% or charted history) and followed for major adverse cardiovascular events [myocardial infarction, stroke, death (MACE) or coronary revascularization]. Patient characteristics, health history, laboratory data, and statin prescription rates were measured at baseline and at one year after CAC scoring., RESULTS: A total of 12,194 subjects with available HbA1c underwent CAC scoring during the study period (6462 diabetes, 2062 prediabetes, and 3670 without diabetes). At a median follow-up of 1.2years, there were 458 MACE events (71 patients without diabetes, 66 patients with prediabetes, and 321 patients with diabetes). Among patients with diabetes or prediabetes, increased CAC was associated with MACE (HR 1.38 [1.26-1.51], p<0.001) and MACE or revascularization (HR 1.70 [1.57-1.85], p<0.001). In patients with diabetes, CAC category was associated with greater statin initiation (89.6% for CAC>=400 vs 60.1% for CAC=0, p<0.001) and high intensity statin initiation (42.2% for CAC>=400 vs 16.8% for CAC=0, p<0.001) at one year post CAC scoring. Patients with diabetes had greater reductions in systolic blood pressure, LDL-C, total cholesterol, and triglycerides from baseline with a CAC >=400 compared to a lower CAC category (p=0.007)., CONCLUSIONS: CAC burden is associated with ASCVD risk in patients with diabetes. CAC scoring increases statin prescriptions and reduces ASCVD risk in patients with diabetes, potentially warranting routine CAC assessment in this population. Copyright © 2022.

The myocardial performance index (MPI) was defined as [(IVCT + IVRT)/ET]. Our aim was to investigate if cardiac time intervals can be used to predict atrial fibrillation (AF) in the general population. Methods and Results: A total of 1915 participants from the general population underwent a health examination including TDI echocardiography. The primary endpoint was AF, and the secondary endpoint was complicated AF as assessed by the occurrence of either stroke or heart failure (HF) after the diagnosis of AF. Participants with known AF were excluded (n = 54). During a median follow-up of 11 years, 166 participants (9%) were diagnosed with AF and of these 44 participants (27%) developed HF or stroke. Assessing the association between IVCT and incident AF, the risk increased with 27% per 10 ms increase in IVCT [per 10 ms increase: hazard ratio (HR) 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.17-1.38); P < 0.001]. The association remained significant after multivariable adjustment [per 10 ms increase: HR 1.22, 95% CI (1.09-1.35); P < 0.001]. No associations between the IVRT, ET, MPI, and AF remained significant after multivariable adjustment. The IVCT also predicted complicated AF and the association remained significant even after multivariable adjustment [per 10 ms increase: HR 1.39, 95% CI (1.06-1.81); P = 0.015]. Conclusion(s): In the general population, the IVCT provides novel and independent prognostic information on the long-term risk of AF.

Retrospective cohort study on 82 MTHFR TT, 54 MTHFR TC and 34 MTHFR CC participants; data regarding age, sex, age at IS, history of dyslipidaemia, hypertension, smoking, migraine and homocysteine (HC) as well as neuroimaging were collected. Age at IS was lower in MTHFR TT than MTHFR TC and CC (35 +/- 4 vs 38 +/- 0 vs 40 +/- 3 years, respectively, p = 0.002); plasma HC (median, interquartile range) was higher in MTHFR TT than in the other groups [16.7 (11.8, 28.6) vs 11.4 (8.2, 16.1) vs 9.8 (7.9, 1.3) respectively, p < 0.0001)] and was higher in SVD than LVD [17.4 (12.4, 32.5) vs 11.4 (8.8, 16.4) p < 0.0001]. MTHFR TT independently predicted age at IS (p = 0.0008) alongside smoking both as a categorical (p = 0.003) or continuous variable (p = 0.02), whereas HC independently predicted SVD as categorical (p = 0.01) and continuous variable (p < 0.0001). Smoking positively predicted plasma HC (p = 0.005) and negatively the activated partial thromboplastin ratio (aPTTr) (p = 0.02). Juvenile IS carriers of the MTHFR TT genotype develop their 1st occlusion on average 5 years earlier compared to the CC genotype; smoking contributes to this prematurity adversely affecting plasma HC and coagulation whereas plasma HC predicts IS secondary to SVD. Public health campaigns against smoking should highlight the prematurity of IS in the juvenile population.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Authors":"Ames, P.

There is accumulating evidence that CAD pathogenesis differs for individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, the genetic background has not been extensively studied. We aimed to discover genetic loci increasing CAD susceptibility, especially in T1D, to examine the function of these discoveries and to study the role of the known risk loci in T1D., METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed the largest genome-wide association study to date for CAD in T1D, comprising 4869 individuals with T1D (cases/controls: 941/3928). Two loci reached genome-wide significance, rs1970112 in CDKN2B-AS1 [odds ratio (OR) = 1.32, P = 1.50 x 10-8], and rs6055069 on DEFB127 promoter (OR = 4.17, P = 2.35 x 10-9), with consistent results in survival analysis. The CDKN2B-AS1 variant replicated (P = 0.04) when adjusted for diabetic kidney disease in three additional T1D cohorts (cases/controls: 434/3123). Furthermore, we explored the function of the lead discoveries with a cardio-phenome-wide analysis. Among the eight suggestive loci (P < 1 x 10-6), rs70962766 near B3GNT2 associated with central blood pressure, rs1344228 near CNTNAP5 with intima media thickness, and rs2112481 on GRAMD2B promoter with serum leucocyte concentration. Finally, we calculated genetic risk scores for individuals with T1D with the known susceptibility loci. General population risk variants were modestly but significantly associated with CAD also in T1D (P = 4.21 x 10-7)., CONCLUSION: While general population CAD risk loci had limited effect on the risk in T1D, for the first time, variants at the CDKN2B-AS1 locus were robustly associated with CAD in individuals with T1D. The novel finding on beta-defensin DEFB127 promoter provides a link between diabetes, infection susceptibility, and CAD, although pending on future confirmation.

Whether polygenic CAD risk is captured by conventional paradigms for assessing clinical cardiovascular risk remains unclear., OBJECTIVES: This study sought to intersect polygenic risk with guideline-based recommendations and management patterns for CAD primary prevention., METHODS: A genome-wide CAD PRS was applied to 47,108 individuals across 3 U.S. health care systems. The authors then assessed whether primary prevention patients at high polygenic risk might be distinguished on the basis of greater guideline-recommended statin eligibility and higher rates of statin therapy., RESULTS: Of 47,108 study participants, the mean age was 60 years, and 11,020 (23.4%) had CAD. The CAD PRS strongly associated with prevalent CAD (odds ratio: 1.4 per SD increase in PRS; p < 0.0001). High polygenic risk (top 20% of PRS) conferred 1.9-fold odds of developing CAD (p < 0.0001). However, among primary prevention patients (n = 33,251), high polygenic risk did not correspond with increased recommendations for statin therapy per the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (46.2% for those with high PRS vs. 46.8% for all others, p = 0.54) or U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (43.7% vs. 43.7%, p = 0.99) or higher rates of statin prescriptions (25.0% vs. 23.8%, p = 0.04). An additional 4.1% of primary prevention patients may be recommended for statin therapy if high CAD PRS were considered a guideline-based risk-enhancing factor., CONCLUSIONS: Current paradigms for primary cardiovascular prevention incompletely capture a polygenic susceptibility to CAD. An opportunity may exist to improve CAD prevention efforts by integrating both genetic and clinical risk. Copyright © 2020 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

Identifying genetic contributors to stroke among AAs with hypertension is critical to understanding the genetic basis of the disease, as well as detecting at-risk individuals. Method(s): In a population comprising over 10,700 AAs treated for hypertension from the Genetics of Hypertension Associated Treatments (GenHAT) and Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) studies, we performed an inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis of incident stroke. Additionally, we tested the predictive accuracy of a polygenic risk score (PRS) derived from a European ancestral population in both GenHAT and REGARDS AAs aiming to evaluate cross-ethnic performance. Result(s): We identified 10 statistically significant (p < 5.00E-08) and 90 additional suggestive (p < 1.00E-06) variants associated with incident stroke in the meta-analysis. Six of the top 10 variants were located in an intergenic region on chromosome 18 (LINC01443-LOC644669). Additional variants of interest were located in or near the COL12A1, SNTG1, PCDH7, TMTC1, and NTM genes. Replication was conducted in the Warfarin Pharmacogenomics Cohort (WPC), and while none of the variants were directly validated, seven intronic variants of NTM proximal to our target variants, had a p-value <5.00E-04 in the WPC. The inclusion of the PRS did not improve the prediction accuracy compared to a reference model adjusting for age, sex, and genetic ancestry in either study and had lower predictive accuracy compared to models accounting for established stroke risk factors. These results demonstrate the necessity for PRS derivation in AAs, particularly for diseases that affect AAs disproportionately. Conclusion(s): This study highlights biologically plausible genetic determinants for incident stroke in hypertensive AAs. Ultimately, a better understanding of genetic risk factors for stroke in AAs may give new insight into stroke burden and potential clinical tools for those among the highest at risk.Copyright © 2021 Armstrong, Srinivasasainagendra, Patki, Tanner, Hidalgo, Tiwari, Limdi, Lange, Lange, Arnett and Irvin.","Authors":"Armstrong, N.

Data are limited regarding genetic screening strategies and outcomes associated with putative pathogenic variants (PuPV) in cardiomyopathy-associated genes in the general population. Objective(s): We aimed to determine the risk of mortality and cardiomyopathy-related outcomes associated with PuPV in cardiomyopathy-associated genes in UK Biobank. Method(s): Using whole exome sequencing data, variants in dilated, hypertrophic and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy-associated genes with at least limited evidence of disease causality according to ClinGen Expert Panel curations, were annotated using REVEL (>=0.65) and ANNOVAR (predicted loss of function) to identify PuPVs. Individuals with PuPV comprised the genotype-positive (G+) and those without PuPV the genotype-negative (G-) cohorts. Group comparisons were made using time-to-event analyses for the primary (all-cause mortality) and secondary outcomes (diagnosis of cardiomyopathy; composite outcome of diagnosis of cardiomyopathy, heart failure, arrhythmia, stroke, and death). Result(s): Among 200,619 participants, 22,401 (11.2%) were found to host >=1 PuPV in cardiomyopathy-associated genes (G+). After adjusting for age and sex, G+ individuals had increased all-cause mortality [HR 1.07 (95%CI 1.02-1.13; p=0.011)] and increased rates of diagnosis of cardiomyopathy later in life [HR 2.37 (95%CI 1.98-2.85; p<0.0001)], which further increased in those with PuPV in definitive/strong evidence ClinGen genes [3.25 (95%CI 2.63-4.00; p<0.0001)]. G+ individuals had a higher risk of developing the composite outcome [HR 1.11 (95%CI 1.06-1.15; p<0.0001)].

An external validation cohort from a separate network from 2015 to 2020 included 39 051 patients. Model features were defined using electronic health record codified data and narrative data with NLP.

We performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to examine whether genetically predicted PA and sedentary behavior are related to coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke. Methods and Results: We used single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with self-reported moderate to vigorous PA (n = 17), accelerometer based PA (n = 7) and accelerometer fraction of accelerations > 425 milli-gravities (n = 7) as well as sedentary behavior (n = 6) in the UK Biobank as instrumental variables in a two sample MR approach to assess whether these exposures are related to coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction in the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D genome-wide association study (GWAS) or ischemic stroke in the MEGASTROKE GWAS.

There is no accurate prediction model for IA or ASAH in the general population. Recent discoveries in genetic risk for IA may allow improved risk prediction. Method(s): We constructed a genetic risk score including genetic association data for IA and 17 traits related to IA (a metaGRS) to predict ASAH incidence and IA presence. The metaGRS was trained in 1,161 IA cases and 407,392 controls in the UK Biobank and validated in combination with risk factors blood pressure, sex, and smoking in 828 IA cases and 68,568 controls from the Nordic HUNT study. We further assessed association between genetic risk load and patient characteristics in a cohort of 5,560 IA patients. Result(s): The hazard ratio for ASAH incidence was 1.34 (95% confidence interval = 1.20-1.51) per SD increase of metaGRS. Concordance index increased from 0.63 [0.59-0.67] to 0.65 [0.62-0.69] upon including the metaGRS on top of clinical risk factors. The odds ratio for prediction of IA presence was 1.09 [95% confidence interval: 1.01-1.18], but did not improve area under the curve. The metaGRS was statistically significantly associated with age at ASAH (beta=-4.82x10-3 per year [-6.49x10-3 to -3.14x10-3], P=1.82x10-8), and location at the internal carotid artery (OR=0.92 [0.86 to 0.98], P=0.0041). Conclusion(s): The metaGRS was predictive of ASAH incidence with modest added value over clinical risk factors. Genetic risk plays a role in clinical heterogeneity of IA. Additional studies are needed to identify the biological mechanisms underlying this heterogeneity.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

However, few studies in either men or women have evaluated metabolomic profiles and incident stroke., METHODS: We applied liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to measure 519 plasma metabolites in a discovery set of women in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS; 454 incident ischemic stroke cases, 454 controls) with validation in 2 independent, prospective cohorts: Prevencion con Dieta Mediterranea (PREDIMED; 118 stroke cases, 791 controls) and Nurses' Health Study 2 (NHS2; 49 ischemic stroke cases, 49 controls). We applied logistic regression models with stroke as the outcome to adjust for multiple risk factors; the false discovery rate was controlled through the q value method., RESULTS: Twenty-three metabolites were significantly associated with incident stroke in NHS after adjustment for traditional risk factors (q < 0.05). Of these, 14 metabolites were available in PREDIMED and 3 were significantly associated with incident stroke: methionine sulfoxide, N6-acetyllysine, and sucrose (q < 0.05). In NHS2, one of the 23 metabolites (glucuronate) was significantly associated with incident stroke (q < 0.05). For all 4 metabolites, higher levels were associated with increased risk. These 4 metabolites were used to create a stroke metabolite score (SMS) in the NHS and tested in PREDIMED. Per unit of standard deviation of SMS, the odds ratio for incident stroke was 4.12 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.26-7.51) in PREDIMED, after adjustment for risk factors. In PREDIMED, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the model including SMS and traditional risk factors was 0.70 (95% CI 0.75-0.79) vs the AUC for the model including the traditional risk factors only of 0.65 (95% CI 0.70-0.75), corresponding to a 5% improvement in risk prediction with SMS (p < 0.005)., DISCUSSION: Metabolites associated with stroke included 2 amino acids, a carboxylic acid, and sucrose. A composite SMS including these metabolites was associated with ischemic stroke and showed improvement in risk prediction beyond traditional risk factors., CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that a SMS accurately predicts incident ischemic stroke risk.

We examined the relationship between baseline ultrasound and inflammation measurements and subsequent primary ischemic stroke risk. Method(s): In this secondary analysis of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), the primary outcome is the incident ischemic stroke during follow-up. The predictor variables are 9 carotid ultrasound-derived measurements and 6 serum inflammation measurements from the baseline study visit. We fit Cox regression models to the outcome of ischemic stroke. The baseline model included patient age, hypertension, diabetes, total cholesterol, smoking, and systolic blood pressure. Goodness-of-fit statistics were assessed to compare the baseline model to a model with ultrasound and inflammation predictor variables that remained significant when added to the baseline model. Result(s): We included 5,918 participants. The primary outcome of ischemic stroke was seen in 105 patients with a mean follow-up time of 7.7 years. In the Cox models, we found that carotid distensibility (CD), carotid stenosis (CS), and serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) were associated with incident stroke. Adding tertiles of CD, IL-6, and categories of CS to a baseline model that included traditional clinical vascular risk factors resulted in a better model fit than traditional risk factors alone as indicated by goodness-of-fit statistics. Conclusion(s): In a multiethnic cohort of patients without cerebrovascular disease at baseline, we found that CD, CS, and IL-6 helped predict the occurrence of primary ischemic stroke. Future research could evaluate if these basic ultrasound and serum measurements have implications for primary prevention efforts or clinical trial inclusion criteria.Copyright © 2021 S. Karger AG.

This systematic review aimed to conduct a meta-analysis to determine whether there is an association between GPX4 (rs713041) SNP and the risk of diseases in humans and its correlation with selenium status. Material(s) and Method(s): A systematic search for English-language manuscripts published between January 1990 and November 2022 was carried out using six databases: CINAHL, Cochrane, Medline, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were applied to assess a relationship between GPX4 (rs713041) SNP and the risk of different diseases based on three genetic models. Review Manager 5.4 and Comprehensive Meta-Analysis 4 software were used to perform the meta-analysis and carry out Egger's test for publication bias. Result(s): Data from 21 articles were included in the systematic review. Diseases were clustered according to the physiological system affected to understand better the role of GPX4 (rs713041) SNP in developing different diseases. Carriers of the GPX4 (rs173041) T allele were associated with an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer in additive and dominant models (p = 0.02 and p = 0.004, respectively). In addition, carriers of the T allele were associated with an increased risk of developing stroke and hypertension in the additive, dominant and recessive models (p = 0.002, p = 0.004 and p = 0.01, respectively). On the other hand, the GPX4 (rs713041) T allele was associated with a decreased risk of developing pre-eclampsia in the additive, dominant and recessive models (p < 0.0001, p = 0.002 and p = 0.0005, respectively). Moreover, selenium levels presented lower mean values in cancer patients relative to control groups (SMD = -0.39 microg/L; 95% CI: -0.64, -0.14; p = 0.002, I2 = 85%). Conclusion(s): GPX4 (rs713041) T allele may influence colorectal cancer risk, stroke, hypertension and pre-eclampsia. In addition, low selenium levels may play a role in the increased risk of cancer.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.","Authors":"Barbosa, P.; Abo El-Magd, N.

However, results from epidemiological studies are conflicting. Knowledge on the long-term impact of BIS on cardiovascular outcomes in the general population is lacking. Purpose The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between BIS and coronary heart disease (CHD) including death due to CHD. Methods This investigation is part of The Study of Men Born in 1943', a longitudinal prospective study of men living in the city of Gothenburg, Sweden. This random population sample was examined in 1993 (all at 50 years of age at baseline). A medical examination was performed, and questionnaires were used to evaluate lifestyle factors. Biomarkers for iron stores (serum ferritin and serum transferrin receptor) was analysed from frozen blood samples in 2014. All hospital admissions were registered through national registers during the entire follow-up from 1993 to 2014. HRs were estimated by Cox proportional-hazard regression analyses. Results During the 21 years follow-up period, 120 participants (15.2%) developed CHD and 16 patients (2%) died due to CHD. The all-cause mortality was 15.2% (n=120) including 40 cardiovascular deaths (5.1%). In a multivariable Cox regression analysis, the daily smoking, hypertension and the increased resting heart rate was independent predictors of CHD, while no significant association was found between BIS and risk of CHD. Conclusions In a cohort of middle-aged men from the general population with well validated and prospectively collected data, we did not find any association between serum ferritin or serum transferrin receptor as markers of BIS and CHD events after 21 years of follow-up.

There is little evidence regarding role of MMPs and their genetic polymorphisms in young (<50 years) ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. Method(s): This study included 100 young (18-50 years) STEMI patients and 100 healthy controls. Serum levels of MMP-3, MMP-9 and TIMP were estimated for both patients as well as controls. Additionally, genetic polymorphisms in the MMP-9 gene (-1562 C/T and R279Q) & MMP-3 gene (5A/6A-1612) was evaluated. All these patients were followed up for one year and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) were determined. Result(s): Serum levels of MMP-3 (128.16 +/- 115.81 vs 102.3 +/- 57.28 ng/mL; P = 0.04), MMP-9 (469.63 +/- 238.4 vs 188.88 +/- 94.08 pg/mL; P < 0.0001) and TIMP (5.84 +/- 1.93 vs 2.28 +/- 1.42 ng/mL; P < 0.0001) were significantly higher in patients as compared to controls. Additionally, patients with genetic polymorphisms in the MMP genes (5A/5A, 6A/6A and the AG genotypes) had an increased risk of STEMI. Patients with MACE had significantly higher levels of MMP-9 (581.73 +/- 260.93 vs 438.01 +/- 223.38 pg/mL; P = 0.012). A cutoff value of 375.5 pg/mL of MMP-9 was best able to discriminate patients with STEMI and MACE with sensitivity of 77.3% and specificity of 57%. Conclusion(s): Novel biomarkers such as MMP-3, MMP-9 and TIMP and their genetic polymorphism are associated with the susceptibility for STEMI in young individuals. Higher MMP-9 levels in STEMI patients with MACE suggests its potential role in predicting cardiac remodeling and left ventricular dysfunction.Copyright © 2022","Authors":"Basia, D.; Gupta, M.

The Gensini and COURAGE scores are established angiographic instruments to assess CAD severity, which may also predict future cardiovascular risk. However, it is unclear if these scores are able to depict the increased risk of patients with T2DM and stable CAD (T2DM-SAP)., METHODS: We performed quantitative coronary angiography and assessed the Gensini and COURAGE scores in 124 patients with T2DM-SAP. Angiographic data were compared to patients with stable angina without T2DM (Non-DM-SAP, n = 74), and to patients with acute coronary syndrome and T2DM (T2DM-ACS, n = 53)., RESULTS: T2DM-SAP patients had similar Gensini and COURAGE-scores compared to Non-DM-SAP-patients (Gensini: 14.44 +/- 27.34 vs 11.49 +/- 26.99, p = 0.465; COURAGE: 3.48 +/- 4.49 vs 3.60 +/- 4.72, p = 0.854).

Therefore, these scores should be used with caution in the assessment of future risk of patients with T2DM. However, among T2DM-ACS patients, both scores are increased, reflecting the high cardiovascular risk in this patient population.","Authors":"Battermann, Simone; Milzi, Andrea; Dettori, Rosalia; Burgmaier, Kathrin; Marx, Nikolaus; Burgmaier, Mathias; Reith, Sebastian","Publisher":"Diabetes & vascular disease research","Issue":"9","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1479164120953612","Pages":"1479164120953612","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"angiographic burden of \natherosclerosis measured by Gensini and COURAGE scores are established angiographic instruments to assess CAD severity"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":10,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":15,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":42,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":46,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":49,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":55,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":252,"Title":"Genetic Risk Factors for CVD in Type 1 Diabetes: The DCCT/ EDIC Study","Year":2021,"Country":"","Abstract":"OBJECTIVE The role of genetic factors in the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) for patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) remains unknown. We therefore examined whether previously identified genetic factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) are associated with the risk of CVD above and beyond established demographic and clinical factors in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT)/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) study. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Polygenic risk scores (PRS) and individual genetic variants identified in previous studies were obtained from genome-wide genotyping performed in 1,371 DCCT/ EDIC participants. Two composite CVD outcomes were considered: major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (CVD death or nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI] or stroke) and any CVD (MACE plus confirmed angina, silent MI, revascularization, or congestive heart failure). Cox proportional hazards models assessed the association between the genetic factors and the risk of CVD with adjustment for other factors (including age, lipids, blood pressure, and glycemia). RESULTS CAD PRS was strongly associated with the subsequent risk of any CVD (42% and 38% higher risk per 1-SD increase in unadjusted and fully adjusted models, respectively; P < 0.0001) and with the risk of MACE (50% and 40% higher risk per 1SD increase in unadjusted and fully adjusted models, respectively; P < 0.0001). Several individual single nucleotide polymorphisms were also nominally associated with the risk of any CVD and MACE.

Hair cortisol concentration (HCC) is a promising biomarker for evaluating the contribution of chronic stress to the pathogenesis and prognosis of coronary arterial disease (CAD). In this cross-sectional study of 24 participants, we assessed the risk of CAD associated with HCC and with perceived chronic stress (Perceived Stress Score), controlling for the established risk factors of age, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity. In fully adjusted Poisson regression models, we additionally evaluated CAD risk with the simultaneous inclusion of psychological and physiologic resilience measures (CD-RISC, DHEA-S). Our results show that HCC, but not PSS, is significantly associated with CAD (incident rate ratio 0.99, confidence interval 0.98-1.00, p = 0.01), but the magnitude of the association is weak and inverse, and less than with dyslipidemia and age. The association remained significant after inclusion of the sum of resilience measures via a combined resiliency score. Resilience was not independently significantly associated with CAD. Our findings indicate the contribution of HCC to CAD risk is small in an average-risk population and remains after adjustment for multisystem resilience.

However, the PRS was developed mainly based on the analysis of Caucasian genomes and has not been validated for East Asians. We aimed to evaluate the PRS in the genomes of Korean earlyonset AMI patients (n = 265, age <=50 years) following PCI and controls (n = 636) to examine whether the PRS improves risk prediction beyond conventional risk factors. Results The odds ratio of the PRS was 1.83 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.69-1.99) for earlyonset AMI patients compared with the controls. For the classification of patients, the area under the curve (AUC) for the combined model with the six conventional risk factors (diabetes mellitus, family history of CAD, hypertension, body mass index, hypercholesterolemia, and current smoking) and PRS was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.90-0.94) while that for the six conventional risk factors was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.85-0.93). Although the AUC for PRS alone was 0.65 (95% CI: 0.61-0.69), adding the PRS to the six conventional risk factors significantly improved the accuracy of the prediction model (P = 0.015). Patients with the upper 50% of PRS showed a higher frequency of repeat revascularization (hazard ratio = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.47-3.26) than the others. Conclusions The PRS using 265 early-onset AMI genomes showed improvement in the identification of patients in the Korean population and showed potential for genomic screening in early life to complement conventional risk prediction.Copyright © 2021 Bhak et al.

Although rare genetic variants are well-established contributors to HCM risk, common genetic variants have recently been implicated in disease pathogenesis. Objective(s): To assess the contributions of rare and common genetic variation to risk of HCM in the general population. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This cohort study of the UK Biobank (data from 2006-2010) and the Mass General Brigham Biobank (2010-2019) assessed the relative and joint contributions of rare genetic variants and a common variant (polygenic) score to risk of HCM. Both rare and common variant predictors were then evaluated in the context of relevant clinical risk factors. Data analysis was conducted from May 2021 to February 2022. Exposures: Pathogenic rare variants, common-variant (polygenic) score, and clinical risk factors. Main Outcomes and Measures: Risk of HCM. Result(s): The primary study population comprised 184511 individuals from the UK Biobank. Mean (SD) age was 56 (8) years, 83690 (45%) of participants were men, and 204 (0.1%) participants had HCM. Of 51 genes included in clinical genetic testing panels for HCM, pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in 14 core genes (designated by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics [ACMG]) were associated with 55-fold higher odds (95% CI, 35-83) of HCM, while those in the remaining 37 non-ACMG genes were not significantly associated with HCM (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 0.6-4.0). ClinVar pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations in MYBPC3 (OR, 72; 95% CI, 39-124) and MYH7 (OR, 61; 95% CI, 26-121) were strongly associated with HCM, as were loss-of-function variants in ALPK3 (OR, 13; 95% CI, 4.4-28). A polygenic score was strongly associated with HCM (OR per SD increase in score, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.4-1.8), with concordant results in the Mass General Brigham Biobank. Genetic factors enhanced clinical risk prediction for HCM: addition of rare variant carrier status and the polygenic score to clinical risk factors (obesity, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease) improved the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve from 0.71 (95% CI, 0.65-0.77) to 0.82 (95% CI, 0.77-0.87).

Thus, accurate and reliable atherosclerotic carotid wall detection and plaque measurements are crucial. Current measurement methods are time-consuming and do not utilize the power of knowledge-based paradigms such as artificial intelligence (AI). We present an AI-based methodology for the joint automated detection and measurement of wall thickness and carotid plaque (CP) in the form of carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and total plaque area (TPA), a class of AtheroEdgeTM system (AtheroPointTM, CA, USA). Method(s): The novel system consists of two stages, and each stage comprises an independent deep learning (DL) model. In Stage I, the first DL model segregates the common carotid artery (CCA) patches from ultrasound (US) images into the rectangular wall and non-wall patches. The characterized wall patches are integrated to form the region of interest (ROI), which is then fed into Stage II. In Stage II, the second DL model segments the far wall region. Lumen-intima (LI) and media-adventitial (MA) boundaries are then extracted from the wall region, which is then used for cIMT and PA measurement. Result(s): Using the database of 250 carotid scans, the cIMT error using the AI model is 0.0935+/-0.0637 mm, which is lower than those of all previous methods. The PA error is found to be 2.7939+/-2.3702 mm2. The system's correlation coefficient (CC) between AI and ground truth (GT) values for cIMT is 0.99 (p < 0.0001), which is higher compared with the CC of 0.96 (p < 0.0001) shown by the earlier DL method. The CC for PA between AI and GT values is 0.89 (p < 0.0001). Conclusion(s): A novel AI-based strategy was applied to carotid US images for the joint detection of carotid wall thickness (cWT) and plaque area (PA), followed by cIMT and PA measurement. This AI-based strategy shows improved performance using the patch technique compared with previous methods using full carotid scans.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Authors":"Biswas, M.; Saba, L.; Chakrabartty, S.; Khanna, N.

The study was planned to examine the relationship between carbonyl stress markers and the risk of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)., METHODS: Forty T2DM patients with ACS and forty T2DM patients without ACS participated in this cross-sectional pilot study. Routine biochemical investigations, creatine kinase-total (CK-T), and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) levels were estimated. Serum carbonyl stress markers were analysed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Binary logistics regression was done to determine the predictive value of carbonyl stress markers for ACS., RESULTS: Fasting plasma glucose, serum total methylglyoxal (MG), methylglyoxal derived hydroimidazolones-1 (MG-H1), and Nepsilon-carboxymethyl-lysine (CML) levels were significantly higher in T2DM patients with ACS than in those without ACS. Serum glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and glyoxalase-1 (GLO1) levels were significantly lower in T2DM patients with ACS than in those without ACS.

Machine learning is increasingly used to identify novel predictors of CVD risk, but prediction improvements beyond established risk scores are uncertain. We evaluated improvements in predicting 5-year AF risk when adding novel candidate variables identified by machine learning to the CHARGE-AF Enriched score, which includes age, race/ethnicity, height, weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, current smoking, use of antihypertensive medication, diabetes, and NT-proBNP. We included 3,534 participants (mean age, 61.3 years; 52.0% female) with complete data from the prospective Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Incident AF was defined based on study electrocardiograms and hospital discharge diagnosis ICD-9 codes, supplemented by Medicare claims. Prediction performance was evaluated using Cox regression and a parsimonious model was selected using LASSO. Within 5 years of baseline, 124 participants had incident AF. Compared with the CHARGE-AF Enriched model (c-statistic, 0.804), variables identified by machine learning, including biomarkers, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging variables, electrocardiogram variables, and subclinical CVD variables, did not significantly improve prediction. A 23-item score derived by machine learning achieved a c-statistic of 0.806, whereas a parsimonious model including the clinical risk factors age, weight, current smoking, NT-proBNP, coronary artery calcium score, and cardiac troponin-T achieved a c-statistic of 0.802. This analysis confirms that the CHARGE-AF Enriched model and a parsimonious 6-item model performed similarly to a more extensive model derived by machine learning. In conclusion, these simple models remain the gold standard for risk prediction of AF, although addition of the coronary artery calcium score should be considered.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Authors":"Bundy, J.

These uncertainties may reflect the susceptibility to confounding in observational studies. We aimed to assess genetic correlations and causal relationships between ischemic stroke and diverse phenotypes. Method(s): Summary-level data for ischemic stroke (34,217 cases and 406,111 controls) from the MEGASTROKE consortium were used as the outcome. Exposures were derived from two GWAS statistics curated databases. We explored the genetic correlations and causalities between hundreds of traits and ischemic stroke, using linkage disequilibrium score regression and Mendelian randomization (MR), respectively. Multiple sensitivity analyses were also performed. Result(s): Genetic correlation analyses reflected genetic overlaps between ischemic stroke and physical activity, cardiometabolic factors, smoking, and lung function. Applying MR, we found suggestive evidence that genetic predisposition to higher concentration of low-density lipoprotein particles (LDL.P) and cholesterol carried in different sizes of LDL.P (LDL.C) were associated with higher risk of ischemic stroke, particular large artery stroke. The strongest effect was observed for small LDL.P in large artery stroke (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.09-1.56, p = 0.003). The results were overall robust for sensitivity analyses. We further observed significant positive associations of genetically predicted LDL.P and LDL.C with coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction. Conclusion(s): Shared genetic overlaps might exist between ischemic stroke and physical activity, cardiometabolic factors, smoking, and lung function. We provided suggestive evidence for a potential causal role of LDL.P and LDL.C in ischemic stroke, particularly in large artery stroke.

Multivariate Cox regressions examined the associations between the candidate variables and the outcome. PAD development/progression was defined by a reduction in ABI >= 0.15 (to a level < 0.9) or limb revascularization procedures, lower-extremity amputations or death due to PAD. The improvement in risk discrimination was assessed by increases in C-statistics of the models., RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients developed/progressed PAD: 50 reduced ABI to < 0.9, seven had lower-limb revascularizations, and 20 had amputations or death. Age, male sex, diabetes duration, presence of microvascular complications (peripheral neuropathy and diabetic kidney disease), baseline HbA1c, 24-h systolic BP (SBP) and mean cumulative office SBP and LDL-cholesterol were associated with PAD development/progression in several models. CIMT and cf-PWV were additionally associated with PAD outcomes, and their inclusion further improved risk discrimination (with C-statistic increases between 0.025 and 0.030).

We derived cut-off values for left atrial emptying fraction (LAEF), left atrial function index (LAFI) and left atrial reservoir strain (LARS) to define left atrial dysfunction using receiver-operating curve threshold analysis. Main outcome was the incidence of cardiac events and atrial fibrillation (AFib) on average 8.5 years later., RESULTS: For prediction of new-onset AFib, left atrial cut-offs yielding the best balance between sensitivity and specificity (highest Youden index) were: LAEF less than 55%, LAFI less than 40.5 and LARS less than 23%. Applying these cut-offs, abnormal LAEF, LAFI and LARS were, respectively, present in 27, 37.1 and 18.1% of the cohort. Abnormal LARS (<23%) was independently associated with higher risk for cardiac events and new-onset AFib (P <= 0.012). Participants with both abnormal LAEF and LARS presented a significantly higher risk to develop cardiac events (hazard ratio: 2.10; P = 0.014) and AFib (hazard ratio: 6.45; P = 0.0036) than normal counterparts. The concomitant presence of an impaired LARS and LV global longitudinal strain improved prognostic accuracy beyond a clinical risk model for cardiac events and the CHARGE-AF Risk Score for AFib., CONCLUSION: Left atrial dysfunction based on outcome-driven thresholds predicted cardiac events and AFib independent of conventional risk factors.

NLR was not predictive of AF after adjusting for confounders (quartile 2: HR: 0.966 [0.874, 1.07], p = .499; quartile 3: HR: 0.978 [0.884, 1.08], p = .661; quartile 4: HR: 1.05 [0.935, 1.16], p = .462)., CONCLUSION: NLR is a significant predictor of new-onset ischaemic stroke after adjusting for significant confounders in Chinese type 2 diabetes patients.

Machine learning holds great promise for improving the accuracy of disease prediction and risk stratification in CVD. However, there is currently no clinically applicable risk stratification model for the Asian population. This study developed a machine learning-based CHD and CIS model to address this issue. Method(s): A case-control study was conducted based on 8, 624 electronic medical records from 2008 to 2019 at the Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. Two machine learning methods (the random down-sampling method and the random forest method) were integrated into 2 ensemble models (the CHD model and the CIS model). The trained models were then interpreted using Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Result(s): The CHD and CIS models achieved good performance with the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.895 and 0.884 in random testing, and 0.905 and 0.889 in sequential testing, respectively. We identified 4 common factors between CHD and CIS: age, brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity, hypertension, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Moreover, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was identified as an independent indicator for CHD. Conclusion(s): Our ensemble models can provide risk stratification for CHD and CIS with clinically applicable performance. By interpreting the trained models, we provided insights into the common and unique indicators in CHD and CIS. These findings may contribute to a better understanding and management of risk factors associated with CVD.Copyright © Annals of Translational Medicine.","Authors":"Chen, B.; Ruan, L.; Yang, L.; Zhang, Y.; Lu, Y.; Sang, Y.; Jin, X.; Bai, Y.; Zhang, C.; Li, T.","Publisher":"Annals of Translational Medicine","Issue":"21","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.21037/atm-22-1916","Pages":"1156","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"machine learning on electronic medical records"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":3,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":28,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":42,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":47,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":58,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":524,"Title":"Causal Associations Between Circulating Adipokines and Cardiovascular Disease: A Mendelian Randomization Study","Year":2022,"Country":"","Abstract":"Context: Observational studies have suggested associations between adipokines and cardiovascular disease (CVD), but the roles of certain adipokines remain controversial, and these associations have not yet been ascertained causally. Objective(s): To investigate whether circulating adipokines causally affect the risk of CVD using 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR). Method(s): Independent genetic variants strongly associated with adiponectin, resistin, chemerin, and retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4) were selected from public genome-wide association studies. Summary-level statistics for CVD, including coronary artery disease (CAD), myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation (AF), heart failure (HF), and stroke and its subtypes were collected. The inverse-variance weighted and Wald ratio methods were used for the MR estimates. The MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier, weighted median, MR-Egger, leave-one-out analysis, MR Steiger, and colocalization analyses were used in the sensitivity analysis. Result(s): Genetically predicted resistin levels were positively associated with AF risk (odds ratio [OR] 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.13; P = 4.1 x 10-5), which was attenuated to null after adjusting for blood pressure. We observed suggestive associations between higher genetically predicted chemerin levels and an increased risk of CAD (OR 1.27; 95% CI, 1.01-1.60; P = 0.040), higher genetically predicted RBP4 levels and an increased risk of HF (OR 1.14; 95% CI, 1.02-1.27; P = 0.024). There was no causal association between genetically predicted adiponectin levels and CVD risk. Conclusion(s): Our findings reveal the causal association between resistin and AF, probably acting through blood pressure, and suggest potential causal associations between chemerin and CAD, RBP4, and HF.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

We measured ABI, TBI, and Doppler ultrasound in 100 predialysis patients with CKD without revascularization or amputation. Leg-specific ABI was calculated using higher systolic blood pressure (SBP) in posterior tibial or dorsalis pedis artery divided by higher brachial SBP; alternative ABI was calculated using lower SBP in posterior tibial or dorsalis pedis artery. PAD was defined as >=50% stenosis detected by Doppler ultrasound. PAD risk classification score was calculated using cardiovascular disease risk factors. The area under the curve (AUC, 95% confidence interval [CI]) for discriminating ultrasound-diagnosed PAD was 0.78 (0.69 to 0.87) by ABI, 0.80 (0.71 to 0.89) by alternative ABI, and 0.74 (0.63 to 0.86) by TBI. Sensitivity and specificity were 25% and 97% for ABI <=0.9, 41% and 95% for alternative ABI <=0.9, and 45% and 93% for TBI <=0.7, respectively.

Three statistical approaches, inverse-variance weighted (IVW), weighted median, and MR-Egger regression method were conducted to assess the casual relationship. The exposure was WC, measured by 46 single-nucleotide polymorphisms from GIANT and the outcome was the risk of CHD. Then, we used the genetic data from Neale Lab and TAG to infer whether WC causally affected the established risk factors of CHD., RESULTS: The IVW method presented that genetically predicted WC was positively casually associated with CHD (odds ratio [OR]: 1.57, 95% CI = 1.33-1.84; p = 4.81e-08), which was consistent with the result of weighted median and MR-Egger regression. MR-Egger regression indicated that there was no directional horizontal pleiotropy to violate the MR assumption. Additionally, expanded WC was also associated with higher risk of hypertension and diabetes, higher cholesterol, more smoking intensity, and decreased frequency of physical activity., CONCLUSION: Our analysis provided strong evidence to indicate a causal relationship between WC and increased risk of CHD.

However, genetic tests for FH are not always necessary in the current diagnostic criteria of FH, which might lead to underestimation of the prevalence of FH and a lack of awareness of FH-associated CAD and AMI. We aimed to explore the prevalence of genetically defined FH in the hospital-based population and to determine the impact of FH risk variants on CAD and AMI. Method(s): The study participants were recruited between June 24, 2019 and May 12, 2021, at a medical center in Taiwan, in cooperation with the Taiwan Precision Medicine Initiative (TPMI) project. The prevalence of FH was calculated and the effects of FH pathogenic variants on CAD and AMI were analyzed by logistic regression models and shown as ORs and 95% CI. Result(s): The prevalence of genetically defined FH was 1.13% in the hospital-based population in Taiwan. Highest LDL and total cholesterol levels were observed in patients with LDLR rs28942084 (LDL 219.4+/-55.2; total cholesterol 295.8+/-55.4). There was an approximately 4-fold increased risk of hyperlipidemia in subjects with the LDLR rs769446356 polymorphism (OR, 4.42; 95% CI, 1.92-10.19) and AMI in individuals with the LDLR rs730882109 polymorphism (OR, 3.79; 95% CI, 2.26-6.35), and a 2-fold increased risk of CAD in those with the LDLR rs749038326 polymorphism (OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.31-3.50), compared with the groups without pathogenic variants of FH. Conclusion(s): The prevalence of genetically defined FH was 1.13% in the hospital-based population in Taiwan, which was higher than the rate observed in individuals with clinically defined FH. The risk of CAD and AMI was increased to varying degrees in subjects with different FH risk alleles. Close monitoring and risk stratification strategy are essential in high-risk patients with FH risk alleles to facilitate early detection and treatments.Copyright © 2022 Chen, Chen, Chen, Hsiao, Wei, Chuang, Lin and Lin.","Authors":"Chen, Y.

The present study is to investigate the association between serum Cystatin C and the severity of coronary artery lesions, Gensini score (GS), and the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). A total of 682 CAD patients (230 females, 452 males; mean age 62.6 +/- 10.7 years, range from 31 to 86 years) and 135 controls (41 females, 94 males; mean age 58.0 +/- 10.3 years, range from 38 to 84 years) were recruited in the present study. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was applied to measure serum cystatin C levels and other serum indexes. The estimated glomerular filtration rate and GS were calculated.Serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), uric acid, Cystatin C, and homocysteine (HCY) were significantly elevated in CAD patients compared to controls. There were significant differences regarding total cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, cystatin C, eGFR and GS among stable angina pectoris (SAP), unstable angina group (UAP), and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients. AMI group had an elevated serum Cystatin C, LDL-C, HCY, and GS than SAP and UAP patients. When stratified patient groups by the quartiles of Cystatin C, we found age, the proportion of male and patients with diabetes, HCY, and GS were increased in Q4 than in other quartile groups. Spearman correlation test revealed a positive relationship between Cystatin C, HCY, and GS. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that serum Cystatin C level, presence of hypertension and diabetes, HCY, age, and male were the risk factors for coronary artery lesions. In summary, our results suggested that cystatin C is a promising clinical biomarker that provides complementary information to the established risk determinants. The serum Cystatin C level is strongly associated with GS and could be used to evaluate the severity of coronary artery lesions. Copyright © 2021 the Author(s).

Hence, this study aimed to explore the associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and gene expression with ischemic stroke risk among population who resided at the Northern region of Malaysia. Material(s) and Method(s): Study subjects including 216 ischemic stroke patients and 203 healthy controls were recruited upon obtaining ethical clearance. SNP genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assays. Gene expression levels were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction assays. Statistical and genetic analyses were conducted with SPSS version 22.2, PLINK version 1.07 and multifactor dimensionality reduction software. Result(s): Study subjects with G allele, CG or GG genotypes of SLC17A3 rs9379800 demonstrated increased risk of ischemic stroke with the odds ratios ranging from 1.76-fold to 3.14-fold (p<0.05).

However, previous studies assessed liver enzymes only once at baseline. We investigated the association between liver enzyme variability and the risk of mortality and cardiovascular outcomes in general population., METHODS: A total of 6 496 271 subjects participating in >=3 health examinations within the previous 5 years including the index year (2009-2010) were included. Variability was measured using variability independent of the mean. Cox proportional hazard models adjusting demographic factors, comorbidities, blood pressure, total cholesterol, glomerular filtration rate and baseline liver enzyme level were used., RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 6 years, there were 106 413 deaths (1.6%), 53 385 myocardial infarctions (MI, 0.8%), 65 143 atrial fibrillations (AF, 1.0%) and 50 139 congestive heart failures (CHF, 0.7%). High variability in AST, ALT and GGT was associated with a higher risk for all-cause mortality, MI, AF and CHF. The degree of association was largest for GGT variability. For the highest quartile of GGT variability relative to the lowest quartile, the hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) were 1.32 (1.28-1.35) for all-cause mortality, 1.16 (1.11-1.20) for MI, 1.28 (1.18-1.38) for AF and 1.25 (1.20-1.30) for CHF. These findings were consistent regardless of alcohol consumption, body mass index and degree of fatty liver.

OBJECTIVE(S): We sought to determine the contribution of rare and common genetic variation to AF risk in the general population. METHOD(S): The UK Biobank is a population-based study of 500000 individuals including a subset with genome-wide genotyping and exome sequencing. In this case-control study, we included AF cases and controls of genetically determined white-European ancestry; analyses were performed using a logistic mixed-effects model adjusting for age, sex, the first 4 principal components of ancestry, empirical relationships, and case-control imbalance. An exome-wide, gene-based burden analysis was performed to examine the relationship between AF and rare, high-confidence LOF variants in genes with >=10 LOF carriers. A polygenic risk score for AF was estimated using the LDpred algorithm. We then compared the contribution of AF polygenic risk score and LOF variants to AF risk. RESULT(S): The study included 1546 AF cases and 41593 controls. In an analysis of 9099 genes with sufficient LOF variant carriers, a significant association between AF and rare LOF variants was observed in a single gene, TTN (odds ratio, 2.71, P=2.50x10-8). The association with AF was more significant (odds ratio, 6.15, P=3.26x10-14) when restricting to LOF variants located in exons highly expressed in cardiac tissue (TTNLOF). Overall, 0.44% of individuals carried TTNLOF variants, of whom 14% had AF. Among individuals in the highest 0.44% of the AF polygenic risk score only 9.3% had AF. In contrast, the AF polygenic risk score explained 4.7% of the variance in AF susceptibility, while TTNLOF variants only accounted for 0.2%. CONCLUSION(S): Both monogenic and polygenic factors contribute to AF risk in the general population. While rare TTNLOF variants confer a substantial AF penetrance, the additive effect of many common variants explains a larger proportion of genetic susceptibility to AF.

However, few population-based follow-up studies have addressed the predictive value of apo measurements in stroke risk. The aims of the present study were to analyze the predictive ability of apo measurements in the risk of ischemic stroke. Method(s): Serum apo A-I and apo B levels and calculated apo B/apo A-I ratio were measured at baseline in 2002 in a cohort of 4,204 participants who were followed for a mean of 4.61 years for a stroke event. Result(s): After adjustment for potential confounders, a significantly stepwise increase in the incidence rate of stroke across quartiles of both apo B and the apo B/apo A-I ratio was evident in both genders and across age-groups. The predictive ability of apo B to detect ischemic stroke was comparable with that of the apo B/apo A-I ratio. Furthermore, both apo B and the apo B/apo A-I ratio were better predictors of the risk of ischemic stroke than total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and the TC/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio. Conclusion(s): This cohort study demonstrates that apo B and the apo B/apo A-I ratio were a significant risk predictor of stroke. Furthermore, the predictive ability of apo B and the apo B/apo A-I ratio in stroke risk was better than routine clinical lipid measurements. Thus, measurements of apolipoproteins have superior clinical utility over traditional lipid measurements in identifying subjects at risk for ischemic stroke.Copyright © 2020","Authors":"Chou, Y.

Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) are inflammatory mediators of the endoproteinase family, and their polymorphism and methylation are associated with the development of atherosclerosis and stroke. This study explores this association in the Indian population. Objective(s): To study the association of MMP gene polymorphism and methylation with the risk of stroke. Method(s): A case-control study was conducted on 100 admitted patients (both genders) diagnosed with ischaemic stroke. Another 100 healthy subjects, not suffering from any chronic illness or stroke, were taken as controls. All participants were genotyped for rs3918242 (MMP-9) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism. Methylation of the MMP-9 gene-promoter region was assessed by methylation-specific PCR. Result(s): The case (mean age = 61.3 +/- 7.36 years old) and control (mean age = 60.68 +/- 7.1 years old) groups were age-matched. Among cases, 61 patients were smokers, 55 were diabetic and 53 were hypertensive. A significant risk of ischaemic stroke was associated with the CT genotype (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 7.09; P < 0.001), TT genotype (aOR = 19.75; P < 0.001) and T allele (aOR = 10.71; P < 0.001). MMP-9 methylation decreased the risk of stroke (aOR = 0.23; P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): MMP-9 gene-1562C/T polymorphism (SNP rs3918242) (single-nucleotide polymorphism [SNP] rs3918242) is a potential marker to predict ischaemic stroke and constitutes a significant proportion of the general population. Its polymorphism predisposes to ischaemic stroke, while its methylation is protective.Copyright © Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2021.","Authors":"Choudhari, O.

Method(s): 108,685 participants aged 40-69, with measured biomarkers, linked primary care records and genetic data in UK Biobank were used for model derivation and population health modelling. Prioritisation tools using age, PRS for coronary artery disease and stroke, and conventional risk factors for CVD available within longitudinal primary care records were derived using sex-specific Cox models. Rescaling to account for the healthy cohort effect, we modelled the implications of initiating guideline-recommended statin therapy after prioritising individuals for invitation to a formal CVD risk assessment. Result(s): 1,838 CVD events were observed over median follow up of 8.2 years. If primary care records were used to prioritise individuals for formal risk assessment using age- and sex-specific thresholds corresponding to 5% false negative rates then we would capture 65% and 43% events amongst men and women respectively. The numbers of men and women needed to be screened to prevent one CVD event (NNS) are 74 and 140 respectively. In contrast, adding PRS to both prioritisation and formal assessments, and selecting thresholds to capture the same number of events resulted in a NNS of 60 for men and 90 for women. Conclusion(s): The use of PRS together with primary care records to prioritise individuals at highest risk of a CVD event for a formal CVD risk assessment can more efficiently prioritise those who need interventions the most than using primary care records alone. This could lead to better allocation of resources by reducing the number of formal risk assessments in primary care while still preventing the same number CVD events.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Stepwise logistic regression provided odds ratios for the relationship of age, gender, and individual risk factors not part of the CADPA algorithm with the likelihood of a high risk CADPA score., RESULTS: We studied 1,613 adults with DM (women: 47.3%, ages 22 to 100, mean age 63.2 years).

Method(s): From a sample of 34 287 white British ancestry participants, we estimated functional aortic valve area by planimetry from prospectively obtained cardiac magnetic resonance imaging sequences of the aortic valve. Aortic valve area measurements were submitted to genome-wide association testing, followed by polygenic risk scoring and phenome-wide screening, to identify genetic comorbidities. Result(s): A genome-wide association study of aortic valve area in these UK Biobank participants showed 3 significant associations, indexed by rs71190365 (chr13:50764607, DLEU1, P=1.8x10-9), rs35991305 (chr12:94191968, CRADD, P=3.4x10-8), and chr17:45013271:C:T (GOSR2, P=5.6x10-8). Replication on an independent set of 8145 unrelated European ancestry participants showed consistent effect sizes in all 3 loci, although rs35991305 did not meet nominal significance. We constructed a polygenic risk score for aortic valve area, which in a separate cohort of 311 728 individuals without imaging demonstrated that smaller aortic valve area is predictive of increased risk for aortic valve disease (odds ratio, 1.14; P=2.3x10-6). After excluding subjects with a medical diagnosis of aortic valve stenosis (remaining n=308 683 individuals), phenome-wide association of >10 000 traits showed multiple links between the polygenic score for aortic valve disease and key health-related comorbidities involving the cardiovascular system and autoimmune disease. Genetic correlation analysis supports a shared genetic etiology with between aortic valve area and birth weight along with other cardiovascular conditions. Conclusion(s): These results illustrate the use of automated phenotyping of cardiac imaging data from the general population to investigate the genetic etiology of aortic valve disease, perform clinical prediction, and uncover new clinical and genetic correlates of cardiac anatomy.Copyright © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

The present study aimed to examine the predictive value of serum s-RNYs for CHD events in the general male population. Within the frame of nested-case-control study, the GENES study, we measured the absolute expression of a RNY-derived small RNA, the s-RNY1-5p, in the serum of individuals (without CHD at baseline) who encountered a CHD event within 12 years of follow-up (n = 30) (Cases) and compared them to individuals who remained event-free (Controls) (n = 30). The expression of s-RNY1-5p in serum was significantly upregulated in Cases compared to Controls (p = 0.027). The proportion of CHD event-free was significantly higher among individuals with serum s-RNY1-5p below the median value (631 molecules/mL). In a multivariable model adjusted for age, smoking, hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia, the risk of CHD events increased more than fourfold in individuals with serum s-RNY1-5p above the median value (HR, 4.36; 95% CI 1.22-15.60). A positive association with CHD events was also observed when considering s-RNY1-5p as a continuous variable (p = 0.022).

Here, we tested whether PARP activity in circulating leukocytes was associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Approach and Results: We performed observational and bidirectional Mendelian randomization studies of 3149 Chinese individuals with T2DM who underwent coronary angiography, with leukocyte PARP activity, 16 tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms in PARP1 and PARP2, and 17 CAD risk single-nucleotide polymorphisms analyzed. Of 3149 participants, 1180 who further received percutaneous coronary intervention were prospectively followed for 1 year to track major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Overall, greater PARP activity was cross-sectionally associated with an odds ratio of 1.23 for obstructive CAD, and prospectively with a hazard ratio of 1.34 for 1-year major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events after percutaneous coronary intervention (both P<0.001). Using a genetic score of 5 screened single-nucleotide polymorphisms in PARP1 and PARP2 as the instrumental variable, genetically predicted elevation in PARP activity showed a causal association with obstructive CAD (odds ratio=1.35, P<0.001). In contrast, the genetic risk of CAD had no significant effect on PARP activity. Ex vivo and in vitro cultures of human monocytes showed that rs747657, as the lead single-nucleotide polymorphism strongly associated with PARP activity, caused the differential binding of transcription factor GATA2 (GATA-binding protein 2) to an intronic regulatory region in PARP1, thus modulating PARP1 expression and PARP activity., CONCLUSIONS: Greater PARP activity may have causal roles in the development of obstructive CAD among patients with diabetes mellitus.","Authors":"Cui, Ning-Hua; Yang, Jun-Mei; Liu, Xia'nan; Wang, Xue-Bin","Publisher":"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology","Issue":"10","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1161/ATVBAHA.120.314712","Pages":"2516-2526","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"poly(ADP-Ribose) polymerase (PARP) activity & rs747657 in PARP-1"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":3,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":24,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":43,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":47,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":52,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":718,"Title":"Left atrial echocardiographic parameters predict the onset of atrial fibrillation: the SMASH2 scoring system","Year":2022,"Country":"","Abstract":"Background: As AF-associated morbidity and mortality are increasing, there is an acute need for improved surveillance and prevention strategies to reduce the impact of AF and related strokes. Specific echocardiographic parameters that can best predict future onset of AF within 3 months are lacking. Method(s): Twenty patients with AF, as identified by presence of ICD-9 diagnosis code, were compared with a control group of twenty age- and sex-matched patients selected from the same clinic population but without a diagnosis of AF. Transthoracic echocardiograms (TTE) obtained within 90 days prior to first documented AF episode (study group) or obtained closest to first clinic visit (control) were selected for review. Result(s): Baseline characteristics, including age, BMI, presence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and heart failure were comparable. Increased left atrial (LA) size (end systolic major axis in 2-chamber view: AF 4.62+/-0.03 vs control 3.79+/-0.21, P =0.03), increased mitral inflow (E/A ratio: AF 1.35+/-0.15 vs control 1.06+/-0.07, P =0.04), and reduced LA global longitudinal strain (AF -2.69+/-0.26 vs control - 3.59+/-0.31, P =0.04) were most closely associated with AF compared with the control group. Multivariate logistic regression was used to develop predictive models for AF onset. A combination of imaging and traditional clinical risk factors was the best AF prediction model with AUC of 0.94, which greatly exceeds the current best predictors published. From these parameters, we developed the SMASH2 scoring system for 90- day AF risk estimation. Conclusion(s): Risk factors for AF and early features of atrial cardiomyopathy including male sex, hypertension, LA enlargement, reduced mitral inflow, and reduced LA strain are powerful predictors of AF onset within 90 days, and may be used to prognosticate future AF risk.Copyright © 2022, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Authors":"Darlington, A.

We assessed whether metabolic-syndrome (MetS) severity would remain linked to future CHD and diabetes even when assessed from non-fasting samples., METHODS AND RESULTS: Participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study were assessed at 4 visits and followed for 20-years of adjudicated CHD outcomes. We used Cox proportional-hazard models (for 20-year CHD outcomes) and logistic regression (for 9-year diabetes outcomes) to compare incident disease risk associated with a race/ethnicity-specific MetS-severity Z-score (MetS-Z) calculated in participants who were fasting (>=8 h) or non-fasting. All analyses were adjusted for sex, race, education, income and smoking. MetS Z-scores were overall similar between participants who were always fasting vs. those non-fasting at Visits 1-3 (all values -0.1 to 0.4), while MetS-Z for participants who were non-fasting at Visit-4 were higher at each visit. Baseline MetS-Z was linked to future CHD when calculated from both fasting and non-fasting measurements, with hazard ratio (HR) for fasting MetS-Z 1.53 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.42, 1.66) and for non-fasting 1.28 (CI 1.08, 1.51). MetS-Z at Visit-1 also remained linked to future diabetes when measured from non-fasting samples, with odds ratio for fasting MetS-Z 3.10 (CI 2.88, 3.35) and for non-fasting 1.92 (CI 1.05, 3.51)., CONCLUSIONS: MetS-Z remained linked to future CHD and diabetes when assessed from non-fasting samples. A score such as this may allow for identification of at-risk individuals and serve as a motivation toward interventions to reduce risk.

Genetic variations in superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPX3), paraoxonase 1 (PON1) and glutathione S-transferase theta 1 (GSTT1) may modulate their gene functions, affecting protein functions. These changes could have an impact on the pathogenesis of HT and progression of CAD. The present study investigated the associations of individual and combined antioxidant-related gene polymorphisms with the incidence of HT and severity of CAD. Two study populations were enrolled. The HT-associated study comprised 735 control and 735 hypertensive subjects (mean age 59.3 +/- 9.0 years), matched for age and sex. The CAD study, hospital-based subjects (mean age 62.1 +/- 9.5 years), included 279 CAD patients and 165 non-CAD subjects. Gene polymorphisms were identified in genomic DNA using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based technique. Genetic variations were assessed for their associations with HT and severity of CAD. Antioxidant gene variants, SOD3 rs2536512-GG, GPX3 rs3828599-GG, PON1 rs705379-TT, and GSTT1-/- and +/-, were independently associated with the incidence of HT. A combination of four HT-associated genotypes, as a genetic risk score (GRS), revealed an association of GRS 5 and GRS >= 6 with increased susceptibility to HT and CAD, and further with multivessel coronary atherosclerosis (multivessel CAD) compared with GRS 0-2 [respective ORs(95% CI) for GRS >= 6 = 2.37 (1.46-3.85), 3.26 (1.29-8.25), and 4.36 (1.36-14.0)].

In recent years, novel knowledge has emerged linking serum uric acid with a variety of conditions and related risk factors, from hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes, to fatal/nonfatal cardiovascular diseases and all-cause death, with the underlying mechanisms involving disrupted neurohormonal and metabolic signaling as well as oxidative stress and inflammation. Importantly, the cut-off value of serum uric acid that predicts the risk of incident events is within the range of normality and below the threshold for increased risk of gout. A large contribution to the advancement in knowledge in the cardiovascular implications of uric acid derives from the Italian study URic acid Right for heArt Health (URRAH)., METHODS: The URRAH study is an Italian nationwide, multicenter retrospective, observational cohort study combining data from outpatients attending hypertension clinics, as well as individuals recruited in prospective observational cohort studies with a follow-up period of at least 20 years up to July 31st, 2017. Data were retrospectively collected from different databases. At the end of the follow-up, the following hard endpoints were evaluated: fatal myocardial infarction; non-fatal acute myocardial infarction; heart failure; fatal stroke; non-fatal stroke; coronary revascularization., RESULTS: A total of 22,714 subjects were included in the analysis. During a median follow-up time of 134 months, a total of 3279 deaths were recorded, of which 1571 were due to cardiovascular causes. Multivariate Cox regression analyses identified an independent association between serum uric acid concentrations and both total (HR=1.53, 95% CI 1.21-1.93, P<0.001) and cardiovascular deaths (HR=2.08, 95% CI 1.146-2.97; P<0.001). Of note, the cut-off values of serum uric acid that were identified as those able to predict total mortality were largely within the normal range (4.7 mg/dL, 95% CI 4.3-5.1 mg/dL). Similarly, the cut-off value that better predicted cardiovascular death was within the normal range (5.6 mg/dL, 95% CI 4.99-6.21 mg/dL). The information on serum uric acid levels provided a significant net reclassification improvement of 0.26 and 0.27 over the Heart Score risk chart for total and cardiovascular mortality, respectively (P<0.001). Serum uric acid levels >=4.7 or <4.7 mg/dL incrementally predicted all-cause mortality over the Heart Score., CONCLUSIONS: The results of studies from the URRAH database further strengthen the role of uric acid in cardiovascular disease, including heart failure, and total mortality. The identified cut-off values support clinicians in investigating serum uric acid levels in their patients and to consider uric acid as an additional cardiovascular risk factor. Taken together, the published papers deriving from the URRAH database emphasize the role of uric acid in favoring cardiovascular events, and strongly suggest the existence of \"grey\" areas, i.e. close but lower than the \"traditional\" threshold for hyperuricemia, which deserve further characterization.","Authors":"Del Pinto, Rita; Viazzi, Francesca; Pontremoli, Roberto; Ferri, Claudio; Carubbi, Francesco; Russo, Elisa","Publisher":"Panminerva medica","Issue":"4","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.23736/S0031-0808.21.04357-3","Pages":"416-423","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"uric acid"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":15,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":25,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":26,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":37,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":42,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":47,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":49,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":50,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":51,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":54,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":785,"Title":"Cardiovascular health in early adulthood predicts the development of coronary heart disease in individuals with type 1 diabetes: 25 year follow-up from the Pittsburgh Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications study","Year":2021,"Country":"","Abstract":"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Type 1 diabetes increases CHD risk. We examined the use of the American Heart Association's cardiovascular health metrics (blood pressure, total cholesterol, glucose/HbA1c, BMI, physical activity, diet, smoking) to predict incidence of CHD among individuals with type 1 diabetes, with the hypothesis that a better American Heart Association health metric profile would be associated with lower incident CHD., METHODS: Prevalence of the seven cardiovascular health metrics was determined using first and second visits from adult participants (mean age 28.6 years) in the Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications prospective cohort study of childhood-onset type 1 diabetes. An ideal metric score (0-7) was defined as the sum of all metrics within the ideal range, and a total metric score (0-14) was calculated based on poor, intermediate and ideal categories for each metric. Incident CHD development (medical record-confirmed CHD death, myocardial infarction, revascularisation, ischaemic electrocardiogram changes or Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications physician-determined angina) over 25 years of follow-up was examined by metric scores., RESULTS: Among 435 participants, BMI, blood pressure, total cholesterol and smoking demonstrated the highest prevalence within the ideal range, while diet and HbA1c demonstrated the lowest. During 25 years of follow-up, 177 participants developed CHD. In Cox models, each additional metric within the ideal range was associated with a 19% lower risk (p = 0.01), and each unit increase in total metric score was associated with a 17% lower risk (p < 0.01) of CHD, adjusting for diabetes duration, estimated glomerular filtration rate, albumin excretion rate, triacylglycerols, depression and white blood cell count., CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Among individuals with type 1 diabetes, higher cardiovascular health metric scores were associated with lower risk of incident CHD. The American Heart Association-defined cardiovascular health metrics provide straightforward goals for health promotion that may reduce CHD risk in the type 1 diabetes population.

We examined the influence of serum lipid parameters and Vit-A on the risk association between neopterin and incident acute myocardial infarction (AMI)., METHODS: We included 4130 patients with suspected stable angina pectoris (SAP), of whom 80% received lipid-lowering treatment with statins. Risk associations between plasma neopterin and AMI are given as HRs per SD increase in log-transformed neopterin., RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 7.5 years, 530 (12.8%) patients experienced an AMI. In age-adjusted and sex-adjusted analysis, plasma neopterin was positively associated with incident AMI (HR (95% CI) per SD: 1.26 (1.17 to 1.35)). However, the estimates were most pronounced in patients with serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) or apolipoprotein (apo) B100 below-median (HR (95% CI) per SD: 1.35 (1.24 to 1.48) and 1.42 (1.27 to 1.58), respectively; both pinteraction <=0.03).

Stress perfusion defect was quantified by visual evaluation of SPECT MPI. SPECT MPI was also used for the quantification of rest and stress MPE. The primary end point was major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) defined as cardiac death, myocardial infarction (MI), and myocardial revascularization > 3 months after SPECT., RESULTS: Forty-four MACEs were observed during a 4.6-year median follow-up.

However, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk, even among those with severe hypercholesterolemia, is heterogeneous, and coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring may be used to clarify risk. We sought to evaluate CAC in patients with severe hypercholesterolemia and measure its impact on real-world statin prescriptions. We identified patients with at least 1 LDL-C >=190 mg100 ml who had a CAC scoring in the Community Benefit of No-Charge Calcium Score Screening Program (CLARIFY) study (NCT04075162) between 2014 and 2020. We explored the CAC distribution, factors associated with CAC >0, and ASCVD risk (myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization, death). A total of 1,904 patients (1.257 women, aged 57.8 +/- 9.3 years) with severe hypercholesterolemia were included. LDL-C ranged from 190 to 524 mg100 ml (mean 215.5 +/- 27 mg100 ml). A total of 864 patients (45.4%) had CAC = 0 and 1,561 (82%) had CAC <100. In patients with LDL-C >=250 mg100 ml, 67 (36.6%) had CAC = 0. Age, male gender, smoking, diabetes, systolic blood pressure, and obesity (ps <=0.001) were associated with CAC >0. In patients with LDL-C >=190 mg100 ml, CAC was associated with a higher risk for ASCVD events (CAC >=100 vs CAC <100, hazard ratio 3.57 [1.81 to 7.04], p <0.001). A higher CAC category was associated with increased statin use after CAC scoring (p <0.001). In patients with severe hypercholesterolemia, 45% had CAC = 0, which was associated with a significantly lower ASCVD risk. CAC was associated with statin prescription and cholesterol lowering.

Inclusion of other variables may improve risk prediction. Objective(s): Identify variables improving CVD risk prediction beyond recalibrated PCE. Design(s): Prospective cohort study; sex-stratified Cox survival models with LASSO stability selection to predict CVD in non-overlapping subsets: variable selection (40%), model training (30%) and testing (30%). Setting(s): UK population. Participant(s): UK Biobank: 121,724 and 182,632 healthy men and women, respectively, aged 38-73 years at baseline. Measurements: Personal/family medical history; lifestyle factors; genetic, biochemical, hematological, and metabolomic blood markers. Outcomes were incident hospitalization or mortality from CVD. Result(s): There were 11,899 (men) and 9,110 (women) incident CVD cases with median 12.1 years follow-up. Variables selected for both men and women were: age, albumin, antihypertensive medication, apolipoprotein B, atrial fibrillation, C-reactive protein, current smoker, cystatin C, family history of coronary artery disease, glycated hemoglobin, polygenic risk score (PRS) for CVD and systolic blood pressure. Also selected: apolipoprotein A1, lipoprotein(a), white blood cell count, deprivation index (men); triglycerides (women). C-statistics for recalibrated PCE were 0.67 [0.66-0.68] and 0.69 [0.68-0.70] in men and women, respectively, improving to 0.71 [0.70-0.72] and 0.72 [0.71-0.73] with LASSO stably selected variables. Categorical net reclassification improvement (7.5% risk threshold) versus PCE was 0.054 [0.038-0.070] (men) and 0.081 [0.063-0.099] (women). Addition of targeted metabolomic data to LASSO stability selection did not improve predictive accuracy. Limitation(s): Analyses were done in a single population study and require external replication.

We aimed for the first time to investigate the potential association of five angiogenesis-related lncRNAs (PUNISHER, SENCR, MIAT, MALAT1, and GATA6-AS) variants with CAD susceptibility and/or severity. TaqMan Real-Time genotyping for PUNISHER rs12318065A/C, SENCR rs12420823C/T, MIAT rs1061540C/T, MALAT1 rs3200401T/C, and GATA6-AS1 rs73390820A/G were run on the extracted genomic DNA from 100 unrelated patients with stable CAD undergoing diagnostic coronary angiography and from 100 controls. After adjusting covariates, the studied variants showed no association with disease susceptibility; however, MIAT*T/T genotype was associated with a more severe Gensini score. In contrast, MALAT1*T/C heterozygosity was associated with a lower score. The lipid profile, and to a lesser extent smoking status, male sex, weight, hypertension, and MALAT1 (T > C) (negative correlation), explained the variance between patients/control groups via a principal component analysis. Incorporating the principal components into a logistic regression model to predict CAD yielded a 0.92 AUC.

Methods: A total of 617 participants without diabetes mellitus, hypertension, known CAD, or stroke who visited the Health Promotion Center from 2009 to 2018 were included in this study. Computed tomography imaging and bioelectrical impedance analysis were used to ascertain the coronary artery calcium (CAC) score, degree of CAD, and FMR. Results: Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that old age, male sex, smoking history, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, uric acid, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly associated with CAC. After adjusting for potential confounding covariates, the presence of CAC was independently associated with FMR (OR, 1.014; 95% CI, 1.002-1.026; p = 0.019.

Methods and Results: This study included 385 292 participants initially free of CVD from UK Biobank. We newly created a healthy sleep score according to five sleep factors and defined the low-risk groups as follows: early chronotype, sleep 7-8 h per day, never/rarely insomnia, no snoring, and no frequent excessive daytime sleepiness. Weighted genetic risk scores of coronary heart disease (CHD) or stroke were calculated. During a median of 8.5 years of follow-up, we documented 7280 incident CVD cases including 4667 CHD and 2650 stroke cases. Compared to those with a sleep score of 0-1, participants with a score of 5 had a 35% (19-48%), 34% (22-44%), and 34% (25-42%) reduced risk of CVD, CHD, and stroke, respectively. Nearly 10% of cardiovascular events in this cohort could be attributed to poor sleep pattern. Participants with poor sleep pattern and high genetic risk showed the highest risk of CHD and stroke.

Furthermore, GM metabolic profiles dramatically differed between HTN and HTN-AF patients, especially the imbalance of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. In HTN-AF patients, circulating palmitic acid and arachidonic acid levels were significantly elevated, while the levels of tetracosahexaenoic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, and stearic acid were decreased (p < 0.001, VIP > 1), mediating 85.99% of gut microbial indirect effects on AF (p < 0.001).

In patients with AIS, disease severity was evaluated using National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, and plasma inflammatory cytokine levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was calculated during a 36-month follow-up period., RESULTS: Lnc-GAS5 expression levels were higher in patients with AIS than in the controls (p < 0.001), and it had the potential to discriminate the controls from patients with AIS (area under the curve: 0.893, 95% confidence interval: 0.849-0.938). In patients with AIS, elevated lnc-GAS5 levels were positively correlated with NIHSS score (r = 0.397, p < 0.001), diabetes mellitus (p = 0.046), and higher levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha; r = 0.374, p < 0.001), interleukin-6 (IL-6; r = 0.223, p < 0.001), and interleukin-17A (IL-17A; r = 0.222, p = 0.015). The expression levels of lnc-GAS5 were also negatively correlated with the levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10; r = -0.350, p < 0.001) and RFS (p = 0.036)., CONCLUSION: Lnc-GAS5 is correlated with higher susceptibility to AIS, inflammation, and severity, and can predict an increased risk of AIS recurrence, indicating that monitoring of lnc-GAS5 might improve the management of AIS.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as crucial mediators in the pathology of CIS; however, their potential importance is yet to be discovered. Herein, we examined the association of four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with the risk of CIS, their correlation with the lncRNAs, MALAT1 and ANRIL, expression, and the potential of serum MALAT1 and ANRIL as biomarkers for CIS. A total of 100 CIS patients and 100 healthy controls were recruited in the study. Genotyping and expression analysis of MALAT1 and ANRIL SNPs were carried out by qPCR. The present results showed that serum MALAT1 was downregulated, while serum ANRIL was overexpressed in CIS patients, relative to controls. MALAT1 downregulation discriminated CIS patients from controls by receiver-operating-characteristic analysis. Moreover, serum ANRIL denoted good diagnostic accuracy. MALAT1 rs619586 AA and rs3200401 CT, TT were associated with increased CIS risk, whereas ANRIL rs10965215 GG was found to be protective. The studied ANRIL rs10738605 polymorphism was not associated with CIS susceptibility. Notably, the G variant of MALAT1 rs619586 demonstrated a higher serum MALAT1 expression level. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed serum MALAT1 as well as MALAT1 rs3200401 CT + TT as independent predictors of CIS. Additionally, a negative association was found between the serum MALAT1 level and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score.

Although total serum BA (TBA) measurement is a readily available clinical test related to coronary artery disease (CAD), myocardial infarction (MI), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the relationship between TBA and these pathological conditions remain unclear, and research on this topic is inconclusive. Method(s): This study enrolled 20,255 menopausal women aged over 50 years, including 6,421 T2DM patients. The study population was divided into different groups according to the median TBA level in order to explore the clinical characteristics of menopausal women with different TBA levels. Spline analyses, generalized additive model (GAM) model and regression analyses based on TBA level were used to explore the relationship between TBA and different diseases independently, including CAD and MI, or in combination with T2DM. Result(s): Both in the general population and in the T2DM subgroup, the TBA level was significantly lower in CAD patients than in non-CAD patients. Spline analyses indicated that within normal clinical range of TBA concentration (0-10 micromol/L), the presence of CAD and MI showed similar trends in total and T2DM population. Similarly, the GAM model indicated that within the 0-10 mumol/L clinical range, the predicted probability for CAD and MI alone and in combination with T2DM was negatively correlated with TBA concentration. Multivariate regression analysis suggested that low TBA level was positively associated with the occurrence of CAD combined with T2DM (OR: 1.451; 95%CI: 1.141-1.847). Conclusion(s): In menopausal women, TBA may represent a valuable clinical serum marker with negative correlation for CAD and MI in patients with T2DM.© Copyright © 2021 Feng, Zhai, Yang, Liu, Zhou and Guo.","Authors":"Feng, X.; Zhai, G.; Yang, J.; Liu, Y.; Zhou, Y.; Guo, Q.","Publisher":"Frontiers in Endocrinology","Issue":"Not Available","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2021.754006","Pages":"754006","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"total serum bile acids (TBA)"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":9,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":3,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":42,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":47,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":49,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":976,"Title":"Value of plasma homocysteine to predict stroke, cardiovascular diseases, and new-onset hypertension: A retrospective cohort study","Year":2020,"Country":"","Abstract":"The influences of hyperhomocysteinemia on cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), stroke and new-onset hypertension are unclear.

Information about stroke, mortality and major adverse cardiac events, and newly onset hypertension was gathered in December each year until 2017. The effects of Hcy levels on the risk for stroke and CVDs among all patients, and new-onset hypertension among patients without hypertension at baseline were evaluated.After adjustment for confounders, compared with the Q1 group (Hcy <10 mumol/L), when the Hcy increased to 10 to 15 mumol/L, the risks for stroke, CVDs, and new-onset hypertension significantly increased, and the hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval were 2.02 (1.35-3.05, P = .001), 2.22 (1.32-3.76, P = .003), and 7.20 (4.52-11.48, P < .001), respectively. Hcy improved the predictive capability of traditional risk factors for stroke. The optimal cut-off value of Hcy for predicting stroke was 13.4 mumol/L (sensitivity: 70.9%, specificity: 62.2%).

The best cut-off point of Hcy for predicting stroke is 13.4 mumol/L.","Authors":"Feng, Yuanyuan; Kang, Kai; Xue, Qiqi; Chen, Yafen; Wang, Wei; Cao, Jiumei","Publisher":"Medicine","Issue":"34","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000021541","Pages":"e21541","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"homocysteine"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":40,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":47,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":58,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":977,"Title":"Association between apolipoprotein B XbaI polymorphisms and coronary heart disease: A meta-analysis","Year":2020,"Country":"","Abstract":"BACKGROUND: To evaluate the association between apolipoprotein B gene polymorphism and coronary heart disease in some populations at home and abroad by means of meta-analysis., METHODS: Using the strict exclusion criteria for primary screening of the literature and applying the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium to test the genetic balance of the selected literature.

The Begg's test and Egger's test were used to evaluate publication bias, and meta-analysis was performed using Stata 12.0., RESULTS: The study included twelve articles. In the literature, a total of 1596 patients with coronary heart disease and 1431 controls.Meta-analysis results showed no statistical value in the following three genetic models: allelic comparison (a vs A,P = 0.811,OR = 0.95, 95%CI = 0.62-1.46), recessive genetic models (aa vs Aa/AA, P = 0.86,OR = 0.94, 95%CI = 0.45-1.96), or dominant genetic models (aa/Aa vs AA, P = 0.73,OR = 0.92, 95%CI = 0.58-1.47).

However, controversy remains regarding a causal role of these traits in stroke pathogenesis. Here, we leveraged genetic data to systematically assess associations between cardiac traits and stroke risk using a Mendelian Randomization framework. Method(s): We studied 66 cardiac traits including cardiovascular diseases, magnetic resonance imaging-derived cardiac imaging, echocardiographic imaging, and electrocardiographic measures, as well as blood biomarkers in a 2-sample Mendelian Randomization approach. Genetic predisposition to each trait was explored for associations with risk of stroke and stroke subtypes in data from the MEGASTROKE consortium (40 585 cases/406 111 controls). Using multivariable Mendelian Randomization, we adjusted for potential pleiotropic or mediating effects relating to atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and systolic blood pressure. Result(s): As expected, we observed strong independent associations between genetic predisposition to atrial fibrillation and cardioembolic stroke and between genetic predisposition to coronary artery disease as a proxy for atherosclerosis and large-artery stroke. Our data-driven analyses further indicated associations of genetic predisposition to both heart failure and lower resting heart rate with stroke. However, these associations were explained by atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and systolic blood pressure in multivariable analyses. Genetically predicted P-wave terminal force in V1, an electrocardiographic marker for atrial cardiopathy, was inversely associated with large-artery stroke. Conclusion(s): Available genetic data do not support substantial effects of cardiac traits on the risk of stroke beyond known clinical risk factors. Our findings highlight the need to carefully control for confounding and other potential biases in studies examining candidate cardiac risk factors for stroke.Copyright © 2022 American Heart Association, Inc.","Authors":"Frerich, S.; Malik, R.; Georgakis, M.

Objective(s): We investigated the association of circulating n-3 and n-6 PUFAs with incident AF in participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Method(s): A total of 6229 participants (mean age = 62 y; 53% female; 39% white, 27% black, 22% Hispanic, and 12% Chinese) who were free of baseline AF and with plasma phospholipid PUFAs measured at baseline using GC were prospectively followed for the development of AF.

Yet, it remains unknown whether blood pressure pulsatility (pulse pressure [PP]) causally affects stroke risk independently of the steady pressure component (mean arterial pressure [MAP]). It is further unknown how the effects of MAP and PP on stroke risk vary with age and stroke cause. Using data from UK Biobank (N=408 228; 38-71 years), we selected genetic variants as instruments for MAP and PP at age <=55 and >55 years and across age deciles. We applied multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses to explore associations with ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and their subtypes. Higher genetically predicted MAP was associated with higher risk of ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage across the examined age spectrum. Independent of MAP, higher genetically predicted PP only at age >55 years was further associated with higher risk of ischemic stroke (odds ratio per-SD-increment, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.13-1.34]). Among subtypes, the effect of genetically predicted MAP on large artery stroke was attenuated, whereas the effect of genetically predicted PP was augmented with increasing age. Genetically predicted MAP, but not PP, was associated with small vessel stroke and deep intracerebral hemorrhage homogeneously across age deciles. Neither genetically predicted MAP nor PP were associated with lobar intracerebral hemorrhage. Beyond an effect of high MAP at any age on ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, our results support an independent causal effect of high PP at older ages on large artery stroke. This finding warrants further investigation for the development of stroke preventive strategies targeting pulsatility in later life.Copyright © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials showed a favorable effect of urate-lowering treatment on systolic blood pressure (mean difference, -2.55 mm Hg [95% CI, -4.06 to -1.05]; P=1x10-3) and major adverse cardiovascular events in those with previous cardiovascular disease (odds ratio, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.22-0.73]; P=3x10-3) but no significant effect on major adverse cardiovascular events in all individuals (odds ratio, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.44-1.03]; P=0.07). In summary, these Mendelian randomization and clinical trial data support an effect of higher serum urate on increasing blood pressure, which may mediate a consequent effect on cardiovascular disease risk. High-quality trials are necessary to provide definitive evidence on the specific clinical contexts where urate lowering may be of cardiovascular benefit.","Authors":"Gill, Dipender; Cameron, Alan C.; Burgess, Stephen; Li, Xue; Doherty, Daniel J.; Karhunen, Ville; Abdul-Rahim, Azmil H.; Taylor-Rowan, Martin; Zuber, Verena; Tsao, Philip S.; Klarin, Derek; Evangelou, Evangelos; Elliott, Paul; Damrauer, Scott M.; Quinn, Terence J.; Dehghan, Abbas; Theodoratou, Evropi; Dawson, Jesse; Tzoulaki, Ioanna","Publisher":"Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)","Issue":"2","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.120.16547","Pages":"383-392","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"MR of urate & systolic blood pressure (SBP)"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":8,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":3,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":26,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":28,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":42,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":47,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":49,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":54,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":1140,"Title":"Risk factors mediating the effect of body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio on cardiovascular outcomes: Mendelian randomization analysis","Year":2021,"Country":"","Abstract":"Background: Higher body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, but the extent to which this is mediated by blood pressure, diabetes, lipid traits, and smoking is not fully understood. Method(s): Using consortia and UK Biobank genetic association summary data from 140,595 to 898,130 participants predominantly of European ancestry, Mendelian randomization mediation analysis was performed to investigate the degree to which systolic blood pressure (SBP), diabetes, lipid traits, and smoking mediated an effect of BMI and WHR on the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral artery disease (PAD) and stroke. Result(s): The odds ratio of CAD per 1-standard deviation increase in genetically predicted BMI was 1.49 (95% CI 1.39 to 1.60). This attenuated to 1.34 (95% CI 1.24 to 1.45) after adjusting for genetically predicted SBP (proportion mediated 27%, 95% CI 3% to 50%), to 1.27 (95% CI 1.17 to 1.37) after adjusting for genetically predicted diabetes (41% mediated, 95% CI 18% to 63%), to 1.47 (95% CI 1.36 to 1.59) after adjusting for genetically predicted lipids (3% mediated, 95% -23% to 29%), and to 1.46 (95% CI 1.34 to 1.58) after adjusting for genetically predicted smoking (6% mediated, 95% CI -20% to 32%). Adjusting for all the mediators together, the estimate attenuated to 1.14 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.26; 66% mediated, 95% CI 42% to 91%). A similar pattern was observed when considering genetically predicted WHR as the exposure, and PAD or stroke as the outcome. Conclusion(s): Measures to reduce obesity will lower the risk of cardiovascular disease primarily by impacting downstream metabolic risk factors, particularly diabetes and hypertension. Reduction of obesity prevalence alongside control and management of its mediators is likely to be most effective for minimizing the burden of obesity.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).","Authors":"Gill, D.; Zuber, V.; Dawson, J.; Pearson-Stuttard, J.; Carter, A.

These molecules can be found circulating in the blood. Recent studies have shown how these biomarkers appear to correlate with the severity of PAD. The levels of these molecules appear to be inversely proportional to each other. Their relationship may provide further insight into the management of the very old diabetic patients with PAD. This study aimed to assess the possible role of sortilin/omentin-1 ratio as easy-to-measure marker in peripheral artery disease (PAD) in type-2 diabetic patients., METHODS: This study analyzed the association between sortilin and omentin-1 serum levels and the presence of clinically significant lower limb PAD in diabetic individuals. We enrolled 295 diabetic patients, including 179 with PAD. Serum levels were collected and correlated with clinical characteristics of the patients., RESULTS: Sortilin concentration was significantly higher in the latter group compared to the former and there was a trend toward increased sortilin levels as disease severity increased. Omentin-1 serum levels were significantly lower in diabetic patients with PAD than in diabetic controls and the levels gradually decreased in proportion to disease severity. The ratio of sortilin to omentin-1 was significantly higher in patients with PAD compared to the other group., CONCLUSION: The sortilin to omentin-1 ratio appears to be a predictive factor for PAD in patients with type-2 diabetes and it may be a promising marker for clinically significant atherosclerosis of the lower limbs. Further studies are needed to confirm this finding and to evaluate its clinical usefulness. Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

In two hospital-based studies, Puerto Rican Hispanics had a lower prevalence of atrial fibrillation of 2.5% than non-Hispanic Whites with 5.7%. This data is particularly controversial because Hispanics possess a higher prevalence of traditional risk factors for developing AF yet have a lower AF prevalence. This phenomenon is known as the atrial fibrillation paradox. Despite recent advancements in understanding AF, its pathogenesis remains unclear. In this study, we compared a genetic dataset of Puerto Rican Hispanics to 111 SNP known to be associated with AF in a large European cohort and determine if they are associated with AF susceptibility in our cohort. To achieve this aim, we performed a secondary analysis of existing data using the following two studies: (1) The Pharmacogenetics of Warfarin in Puerto Ricans study and the (2) A Genomic Approach for Clopidogrel in Caribbean Hispanics, and assess for the presence of European SNPs associated with AF from the genome-wide association study of 1 million people identifies 111 loci for atrial fibrillation. We used data from 555 cardiovascular Puerto Rican Hispanic patients, consisting of 486 control and 69 cases. We found that the following SNPs showed significant association with AF in PHR: rs2834618, rs6462079, rs7508, rs2040862, and rs10458660. Some of these SNPs are proteins involved in lysosomal activities responsible for breaking ceramides to sphingosines and collagen deposition around atrial cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, we performed a machine learning analysis and determined that Native American admixture and heart failure were strongly predictive of AF in PHR. For the first time, this study provides some genetic insight into AF's mechanisms in a Puerto Rican Hispanic cohort.Copyright © 2021 Ariel F. Gonzalez-Cordero et al.","Authors":"Gonzalez-Cordero, A.

A prioritized set of 61 SNPs selected from the NHGRI GWAS catalogue were genotyped using FluidigmNanofluidic SNP Genotyping System and appropriate statistical analyses were used in interpreting the results., RESULTS: After data pruning, out of 45 SNPs qualified for the association analysis, four SNPs were found to be highly significantly associated with increased risk for CAD even after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (p < 0.001). These results were also replicated in the random subsets of the pooled cohort (70, 50 and 30%) suggesting internal consistency. The ROC analysis of the risk scores of the significant SNPs suggested highly significant area under curve (AUC = 0.749; p < 0.0001) implying predictive utility of these risk variants., CONCLUSIONS: The rs10455872 of LP(A) gene in particular showed profound risk for CAD (OR 35.9; CI 16.7-77.2) in this regional Indian population.

Further evaluating the role of retinal vessel anatomy and incorporating it into a scoring system on risk of cardiovascular diseases are needed in future studies.Copyright © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Authors":"Guo, S.; Yin, S.; Tse, G.; Li, G.; Su, L.; Liu, T.","Publisher":"Current Atherosclerosis Reports","Issue":"4","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11883-020-0834-2","Pages":"16","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"quantification of retinal vasculature"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":24,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":37,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":42,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":47,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":58,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":1252,"Title":"Role of adjuvant carotid ultrasound in women undergoing stress echocardiography for the assessment of suspected coronary artery disease","Year":2020,"Country":"","Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Due to the low prevalence of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) in women, stress testing has a relatively low predictive value for this. Additionally, conventional cardiovascular risk scores underestimate risk in women. This study sought to evaluate the role of atherosclerosis assessment using carotid ultrasound (CU) in women attending for stress echocardiography (SE)., METHODS: This was a prospective study in which consecutive women with recent-onset suspected angina, who were referred for clinically indicated SE, underwent CU., RESULTS: 415 women (mean age 61+/-10 years, 29% diabetes mellitus, mean body mass index 28) attending for SE underwent CU. 47 women (11%) had inducible wall motion abnormalities, and carotid disease (CD) was present in 46% (carotid plaque in 41%, carotid intima-media thickness >75th percentile in 15%). Women with CD were older (65 vs 58 years, p<0.001), and more likely to have diabetes (41% vs 21%, p=0.001), hypertension (67% vs 36%, p<0.01) and a higher pretest probability of CAD (59% vs 41%, p<0.001). 40% of women classified as low Framingham risk were found to have evidence of CD. The positive predictive value of SE for flow-limiting CAD was 51%, but with the presence of carotid plaque, this was 71% (p<0.01). Carotid plaque (p=0.004) and ischaemia (p=0.01) were the only independent predictors of >70% angiographic stenosis. In women with ischaemia on SE and no carotid plaque, the negative predictive value for flow-limiting disease was 88%.During a follow-up of 1058+/-234 days, there were 15 events (defined as all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, heart failure admissions and late coronary revascularisation). Age (HR 1.07 (1.00-1.15), p=0.04), carotid plaque burden (HR 1.65 (1.36-2.00), p<0.001) and ischaemic burden (HR 1.41 (1.18-1.68), p<0.001) were associated with outcome. There was a stepwise increase in events/year from 0.3% when there were no ischaemia and atherosclerosis, 1.1% when there was atherosclerosis and no ischaemia, 2.2% when there was ischaemia and no atherosclerosis and 10% when there were both ischaemia and atherosclerosis (p<0.001)., CONCLUSION: CU significantly improves the accuracy of SE alone for identifying flow-limiting disease on coronary angiography, and improves risk stratification in women attending for SE, as well identifying a subset of women who may benefit from primary preventative measures.

Objective(s): This study identified the role of risk factors and risk of vascular events in subjects with asymptomatic ICAS for improved risk stratification. Method(s): Stroke-free participants in the NOMAS (Northern Manhattan Study) trial, prospectively followed since 1993, underwent a brain magnetic resonance angiogram from 2003 to 2008. The study rated stenosis in 11 brain arteries as: 0: no stenosis; 1: <50% or luminal irregularities; 2: 50%-69%; and 3: >=70% stenosis or flow gap. The study ascertained vascular events during the post-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) period. Proportional odds regression quantified the association of pre-MRI exposures, and proportional hazard adjusted models were built to identify the risk of events in the post-MRI period. Result(s): The included sample included 1,211 participants from NOMAS (mean age: 71 +/- 9 years; 59% women; 65% Hispanic; 45% had any stenosis). Older age (OR: 1.02 per year; 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.04), hypertension duration (OR: 1.01 per year; 95% CI: 1.00 to 1.02), higher number of glucose-lowering drugs (OR: 1.64 per each medication; 95% CI: 1.24 to 2.15), and high-density lipoprotein (OR: 0.96 per mg/dL; 95% CI: 0.92 to 0.99) were associated with ICAS. The highest event risk was noted among participants with ICAS >=70% (5.5% annual risk of vascular events; HR: 2.1; 95% CI:1.4 to 3.2; compared with those with no ICAS). Conclusion(s): ICAS is an imaging marker of established atherosclerotic disease in stroke-free subjects, and incidental diagnosis of ICAS should trigger a thorough assessment of vascular health.Copyright © 2021 American College of Cardiology Foundation","Authors":"Gutierrez, J.; Khasiyev, F.; Liu, M.; DeRosa, J.

The role of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in T2DM patients in relation to CAD is not well understood. We examined serum inducible and endothelial nitric oxide synthase activities in patients with T2DM in relation to the presence of coronary artery disease., PATIENTS AND METHODS: The present study was conducted in the Department of Physiology, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Subjects were grouped into control (Group A, n=87), T2DM without CAD (Group B, n=70), and T2DM patients with CAD (Group C, n=49). The selection of T2DM subjects was according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA). Serum iNOS, eNOS, hsCRP, nitrates and nitrites along with lipid profile were compared between different groups. Spearman's correlation and ROC analysis were also performed., RESULTS: Serum eNOS levels were significantly high in the control group (112.38+/-47.16 U/ml) than in DM without CAD (81.43+/-49.91 U/ml) and DM with CAD (84.80+/-43.32 U/ml, p<.001). Serum iNOS levels were significantly higher in DM with CAD (42.87+/-28.83 U/ml) compared to both control (22.08+/-11.77 U/ml) and DM without CAD (16.24+/-12.30 U/ml, p<.001). Additionally, the differences in nitrite and NO were not significant between the three groups (34.06+/-24.75, 33.02+/-21.50, 38.83+/-24.34 uM, p = .384), and (56.51+/-36.78, 49.89+/-28.83 vs. 55.77+/-30.34 uM, p=.416) respectively. ROC curve analysis revealed a sensitivity and specificity of 73.5% and 68.6% of iNOS level at a cutoff point of 21.1 U/ml to predict CAD in T2DM patients. The ROC analysis for iNOS, eNOS, and hs-CRP were .782 (p<.001), .574 (p=.170), and .726 (p<.001), respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Patients with T2DM have significantly higher levels of serum iNOS and lower levels of eNOS. However, iNOS levels were significantly higher in T2DM patients with concomitant CAD. Moreover, iNOS activity positively correlated with glycemic control and hsCRP. Therefore, iNOS could be an emerging future marker for CAD in T2DM patients and its antagonists could be useful in the management of these patients.","Authors":"Habib, S. S.; Al-Regaiey, K.

We recently developed a genome-wide polygenic risk score (PRS) for IS using case-control datasets from 4 large-scale observational studies conducted in Japan. Our objective in the present study was to confirm the association between the PRS and the risk of IS with data from an independent prospective cohort recruited from the general Japanese population. Methods-A total of 3038 subjects aged >=40 years were followed up for 10 years (2002-2012). The genome-wide PRS was calculated using genotype data from >350 000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. The PRS levels were divided into quintiles. High and low genetic risk groups were defined as top 60% and bottom 40% of PRS, respectively. The hazard ratio (HR) for the development of IS was estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model. Results-During the follow-up period, 91 cases developed first-ever IS. The age- and sex-adjusted HR for IS increased with higher PRS levels (P for trend, 0.03). Subjects with the highest quintile level of PRS had a 2.44-fold (95% CI, 1.16-5.12) greater risk for IS than those with the lowest quintile level after adjusting for age and sex. A similar association was observed after adjusting for environmental risk factors (P for trend, 0.03). As compared with low genetic risk group, the age- and sex-adjusted HR in high genetic risk group was 1.63 (95% CI, 1.04-2.55), which was comparable to the HR of hypertension (HR, 1.41), diabetes mellitus (HR, 1.72), and smoking (HR, 1.54). The age- and sex-adjusted HR increased with the number of environmental risk factors in both high and low genetic risk groups without significant interaction. Conclusions-A high genome-wide PRS was a significant risk factor for IS independent of environmental risk factors in a general Japanese population. This finding suggests that PRS may be useful to identify individuals at a high risk of IS.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.","Authors":"Hachiya, T.; Hata, J.; Hirakawa, Y.; Yoshida, D.; Furuta, Y.; Kitazono, T.; Shimizu, A.; Ninomiya, T.","Publisher":"Stroke","Issue":"Not Available","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1161/STROKEAHA.119.027520","Pages":"759-765","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"polygenic risk score (PRS) for ischemic stroke (IS)"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":4,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":28,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":43,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":47,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":54,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":1301,"Title":"Common genetic variants and modifiable risk factors underpin hypertrophic cardiomyopathy susceptibility and expressivity","Year":2021,"Country":"","Abstract":"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common, serious, genetic heart disorder. Rare pathogenic variants in sarcomere genes cause HCM, but with unexplained phenotypic heterogeneity. Moreover, most patients do not carry such variants. We report a genome-wide association study of 2,780 cases and 47,486 controls that identified 12 genome-wide-significant susceptibility loci for HCM. Single-nucleotide polymorphism heritability indicated a strong polygenic influence, especially for sarcomere-negative HCM (64% of cases; h2 g = 0.34 +/- 0.02). A genetic risk score showed substantial influence on the odds of HCM in a validation study, halving the odds in the lowest quintile and doubling them in the highest quintile, and also influenced phenotypic severity in sarcomere variant carriers. Mendelian randomization identified diastolic blood pressure (DBP) as a key modifiable risk factor for sarcomere-negative HCM, with a one standard deviation increase in DBP increasing the HCM risk fourfold. Common variants and modifiable risk factors have important roles in HCM that we suggest will be clinically actionable.Copyright © 2021, Crown.","Authors":"Harper, A.

Characterizing noninvasive markers of myocardial fibrosis on cardiac magnetic resonance, echocardiography, and correlating with biomarkers of fibrosis, myocardial injury, and functional correlates including exercise tolerance. Background(s): CKD is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death. Much of the excess mortality is attributed to uremic cardiomyopathy, defined by increased left ventricular hypertrophy, myocardial dysfunction, and fibrosis. The prevalence of these abnormalities across stages of CKD and their impact on cardiovascular performance is unknown. Method(s): A total of 134 nondiabetic, pre-dialysis subjects with CKD stages 2 to 5 without myocardial ischemia underwent cardiac magnetic resonance (1.5-T) including; T1 mapping (biomarker of diffuse fibrosis), T2 mapping (edema), late gadolinium enhancement, and assessment of aortic distensibility. Serum biomarkers including collagen turnover (P1NP, P3NP), troponin T, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide were measured. Cardiovascular performance was quantified by bicycle cardiopulmonary exercise testing and echocardiography. Result(s): Native myocardial T1 times increased incrementally from stage 2 to 5 (966 +/- 21 ms vs. 994 +/- 33 ms; p < 0.001), independent of hypertension and aortic distensibility. Left atrial volume, E/e, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, P1NP, and P3NP increased with CKD stage (p < 0.05), while effort tolerance (% predicted VO2Peak, %VO2VT) decreased (p < 0.001). In multivariable linear regression models, estimated glomerular filtration rate was the strongest predictor of native myocardial T1 time (p < 0.001). Native myocardial T1 time, left atrial dilatation, and high-sensitivity troponin T were independent predictors of % predicted VO2Peak (p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Imaging and serum biomarkers of myocardial fibrosis increase with advancing CKD independent of effects of left ventricular afterload and might be a key intermediary in the development of uremic cardiomyopathy. Further studies are needed to determine whether these changes lead to the increased rates of heart failure and death in CKD.

One potential factor is the ethnic differences in the role of inflammation in vascular injury. We tested the hypothesis that low-grade inflammation is unequally associated with vascular dysfunction in different ethnic groups. Method(s): we included 5698 participants (similar-sized Dutch, African Surinamese, South-Asian Surinamese, Ghanaians, Turkish, and Moroccans) of the HELIUS study (the Netherlands) conducted between 2011 and 2015. Logistic regression was used to examine the associations of Z-score inflammatory biomarker concentration (high sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP], fibrinogen, and D-dimer) with vascular dysfunction (aortic stiffness, coronary artery disease [CAD], and peripheral artery disease [PAD]), with adjustments for age, sex, smoking (pack-years), BMI, hypertension, HbA1c, total cholesterol, and statin use Findings: in the fully adjusted models, higher Z-score hs-CRP was positively associated with CAD in Dutch [OR 1.63, (95% CI 1.21-2.18)] and PAD in South Asians [1.25(1.03-1.53)], respectively. Higher Z-score fibrinogen was positively associated with CAD in African Surinamese [1.28(1.03-1.59)] while higher Z-score D-dimer was positively associated with PAD in Moroccans [1.39(1.01-1.93)]. Higher Z-score hs-CRP [0.71(0.54-0.94)] and fibrinogen [0.75(0.58-0.97)] concentrations were negatively associated with PAD in African Surinamese. Interpretation(s): our study shows that inflammatory biomarkers are unequally associated with vascular dysfunction in different ethnic groups. These observations provide opportunities for future studies aimed at assessing the predictive roles of inflammation on vascular disease in different ethnic groups.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s)","Authors":"Hayfron-Benjamin, C.

Little is currently known about the molecular mechanisms and immune infiltration patterns underlying the development and progression of thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysms (TAA and AAA), warranting further research. Method(s): We downloaded AA (includes TAA and AAA) datasets from the GEO database. The potential biomarkers in TAA and AAA were identified using differential expression analysis and two machine-learning algorithms. The discrimination power of the potential biomarkers and their diagnostic accuracy was assessed in validation datasets using ROC curve analysis. Then, GSEA, KEGG, GO and DO analyses were conducted. Furthermore, two immuno-infiltration analysis algorithms were utilized to analyze the common immune infiltration patterns in TAA and AAA. Finally, a retrospective clinical study was performed on 78 patients with AD, and the serum from 6 patients was used for whole exome sequencing (WES). Result(s): The intersection of TAA and AAA datasets yielded 82 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Subsequently, the biomarkers (CX3CR1 and HBB) were acquired by screening using two machine-learning algorithms and ROC curve analysis. The functional analysis of DEGs showed significant enrichment in inflammation and regulation of angiogenic pathways. Immune cell infiltration analysis revealed that adaptive and innate immune responses were closely linked to AA progression. However, neither CX3CR1 nor HBB was associated with B cell-mediated humoral immunity. CX3CR1 expression was correlated with macrophages and HBB with eosinophils. Finally, our retrospective clinical study revealed a hyperinflammatory environment in aortic disease. The WES study identified disease biomarkers and gene variants, some of which may be druggable. Conclusion(s): The genes CX3CR1 and HBB can be used as common biomarkers in TAA and AAA. Large numbers of innate and adaptive immune cells are infiltrated in AA and are closely linked to the development and progression of AA. Moreover, CX3CR1 and HBB are highly correlated with the infiltration of immune cells and may be potential targets of immunotherapeutic drugs. Gene mutation research is a promising direction for the treatment of aortic disease.Copyright © 2022 He, Zhan, Cai, Yu, Wei, Quan, Huang, Liu, Li, Liu and Pan.","Authors":"He, B.; Zhan, Y.; Cai, C.; Yu, D.; Wei, Q.; Quan, L.; Huang, D.; Liu, Y.; Li, Z.; Liu, L.; Pan, X.","Publisher":"Frontiers in Immunology","Issue":"Not Available","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2022.1030976","Pages":"1030976","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"CX3CR1 & HBB"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":6,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":37,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":43,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":47,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":49,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":1340,"Title":"Predictive models for abdominal aortic aneurysms using polygenic scores and PheWAS-derived risk factors","Year":2023,"Country":"","Abstract":"Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are common enlargements of the abdominal aorta which can grow larger until rupture, often leading to death. Detection of AAA is often by ultrasonography and screening recommendations are mostly directed at men over 65 with a smoking history. Recent large-scale genome-wide association studies have identified genetic loci associated with AAA risk. We combined known risk factors, polygenic risk scores (PRS) and precedent clinical diagnoses from electronic health records (EHR) to develop predictive models for AAA, and compared performance against screening recommendations. The PRS included genome-wide summary statistics from the Million Veteran Program and FinnGen (10,467 cases, 378,713 controls of European ancestry), with optimization in Vanderbilt's BioVU and validated in the eMERGE Network, separately across both White and Black participants. Candidate diagnoses were identified through a temporally-oriented Phenome-wide association study in independent EHR data from Vanderbilt, and features were selected via elastic net. We calculated C-statistics in eMERGE for models including PRS, phecodes, and covariates using regression weights from BioVU. The AUC for the full model in the test set was 0.883 (95% CI 0.873-0.892), 0.844 (0.836-0.851) for covariates only, 0.613 (95% CI 0.604-0.622) when using primary USPSTF screening criteria, and 0.632 (95% CI 0.623-0.642) using primary and secondary criteria. Brier scores were between 0.003 and 0.023 for our models indicating good calibration, and net reclassification improvement over combined primary and secondary USPSTF criteria was 0.36-0.60. We provide PRS for AAA which are strongly associated with AAA risk and add to predictive model performance. These models substantially improve identification of people at risk of a AAA diagnosis compared with existing guidelines, with evidence of potential applicability in minority populations.","Authors":"Hellwege, Jacklyn N.; Dorn, Chad; Irvin, Marguerite R.; Limdi, Nita A.; Cimino, James; Beasley, T.

The CCL5 is a chemokine that has been suggested to be an important participant in the development of the atherosclerotic plaque. Therefore, in this work, we evaluated whether three polymorphisms located in the promoter region of the CCL5 gene [CCL5 -28 G/C (rs2280788), CCL5-109 G/A (rs1800825), and CCL5-403 G/A (rs2107538)] are significantly associated with the acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and plasma CCL5 levels. The determination of the gene polymorphisms was performed by 5'exonuclease TaqMan assays in 625 patients with ACS and 700 control individuals. Plasma CCL5 levels were evaluated by ELISA. Under co-dominant, dominant, and additive models, the G allele of the -109 G/A polymorphism was associated with a higher risk of ACS (OR = 1.27, pCCo-dom = 0.041, OR = 1.33, pCDom = 0.03, and OR = 1.33, pCAdd = 0.015, respectively). In the same way, under co-dominant and recessive models, the A allele of the -403 G/A polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of ACS (OR = 1.62, pCCo-dom = 0.042, and OR = 1.63, pCRes = 0.012, respectively). The CCL5-109 G allele carriers had a lower concentration of the CCL5 than subjects with the A allele. Also, carriers of CCL5-403 A allele showed a lower concentration of the CCL5 than individuals with the G allele. Our data suggest the association of the CCL5-109 G/A and CCL5-403 G/A polymorphisms with the risk of developing ACS and with a lower concentration of CCL5 in our population.

If multivariable models were shown to have considerable additional value over age alone in predicting AF risk among younger individuals, AF screening could be expanded to patients with lower age, but with high AF risk as per a validated risk model. Methods We validated risk models CHARGE-AF (Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology model for AF) and FHS-AF (Framingham Heart Study model for AF), and risk scores CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc and CHA 2 DS 2 -VA, and presented their predictive abilities for 5-year and 10-year AF risk versus that of age alone in a young Dutch population cohort (PREVEND) free from AF at baseline. We assessed discrimination by the C-statistic and calibration by the calibration plot and stratified Kaplan-Meier plot using survey-weighted Cox models. Results During 5-year and 10-year follow-up there were n=98 (2.46/1000 person-years) and n=249 (3.29/1000 person-years) new AF cases, respectively, among 8265 participants with mean age 49+/-13 years. CHARGE-AF and FHS-AF both showed good discrimination for 5-year and 10-year AF (C-statistic range 0.83-0.86) with accurate calibration for 5-year AF, but overestimation of 10-year AF risk in highest-risk individuals. CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc and CHA 2 DS 2 -VA relatively underperformed. Age alone showed similar discrimination to that of CHARGE-AF and FHS-AF both in the overall, young PREVEND cohort and in subgroups for lower age and lower stroke risk.

Methods We included patients aged >=40 years, free of AF and with complete CHARGE-AF variables at baseline, 1 January 2014, in a representative, nationwide routine primary care database in the Netherlands (Nivel-PCD). We validated CHARGE-AF for 5-year observed AF incidence using the C-statistic for discrimination, and calibration plot and stratified Kaplan-Meier plot for calibration. We compared CHARGE-AF with other predictors and assessed implications of using different CHARGE-AF cut-offs to select high-risk patients. Results Among 111 475 patients free of AF and with complete CHARGE-AF variables at baseline (17.2% of all patients aged >=40 years and free of AF), mean age was 65.5 years, and 53% were female. Complete CHARGE-AF cases were older and had higher AF incidence and cardiovascular comorbidity rate than incomplete cases. There were 5264 (4.7%) new AF cases during 5-year follow-up among complete cases. CHARGE-AF's C-statistic for new AF was 0.74 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.74). The calibration plot showed slight risk underestimation in low-risk deciles and overestimation of absolute AF risk in those with highest predicted risk. The Kaplan-Meier plot with categories <2.5%, 2.5%-5% and >5% predicted 5-year risk was highly accurate. CHARGE-AF outperformed CHA2 DS2-VASc (Cardiac failure or dysfunction, Hypertension, Age >=75 [Doubled], Diabetes, Stroke [Doubled]-Vascular disease, Age 65-74, and Sex category [Female]) and age alone as predictors for AF. Dichotomisation at cut-offs of 2.5%, 5% and 10% baseline CHARGE-AF risk all showed merits for patient selection in AF screening efforts. Conclusion In patients with complete baseline CHARGE-AF data through routine Dutch primary care, CHARGE-AF accurately assessed AF risk among older primary care patients, outperformed both CHA2 DS2-VASc and age alone as predictors for AF and showed potential for automated, low-cost patient selection in AF screening.Copyright © 2021 BMJ Publishing Group.

The use of multivariable prediction models could result in more efficient primary AF screening by selecting at-risk individuals. We aimed to determine which model may be best suitable for increasing efficiency of future primary AF screening efforts Methods We performed a systematic review on multivariable models derived, validated, and/or augmented for AF prediction in and results community cohorts using Pubmed, Embase, and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) through 1 August 2019. We performed meta-analysis of model discrimination with the summary C-statistic as the primary expression of associations using a random effects model. In case of high heterogeneity, we calculated a 95% prediction interval. We used the CHARMS (Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modelling Studies) checklist for risk of bias assessment. We included 27 studies with a total of 2 978 659 unique participants among 20 cohorts with mean age ranging from 42 to 76 years. We identified 21 risk models used for incident AF risk in community cohorts. Three models showed significant summary discrimination despite high heterogeneity: CHARGE-AF (Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology) [summary C-statistic 0.71; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.66-0.76], FHS-AF (Framingham Heart Study risk score for AF) (summary C-statistic 0.70; 95% CI 0.64-0.76), and CHA2DS2-VASc (summary C-statistic 0.69; 95% CI 0.64-0.74). Of these, CHARGE-AF and FHS-AF had originally been derived for AF incidence prediction. Only CHARGE-AF, which comprises easily obtainable measurements and medical history elements, showed significant summary discrimination among cohorts that had applied a uniform (5-year) risk prediction window Conclusion CHARGE-AF appeared most suitable for primary screening purposes in terms of performance and applicability in older community cohorts of predominantly European descent.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

Herein, we examined the association of an aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) gene polymorphism with cerebral infarction. Patients with cerebral infarction (n = 963) and healthy controls (n = 921) were included. Genotyping was performed using gene chip platform analysis, and Sanger sequencing was used to confirm ALDH2 genotypes. The risk prediction of ALDH2 polymorphisms for cerebral infarction was examined under three genetic modes of inheritance. For males, ALDH2*2/*2 genotype was a significant risk factor for cerebral infarction in the co-dominant model (age-, smoking-, and drinking-adjusted OR 1.514, 95% CI 1.005-2.282, p = 0.047) and the recessive model (age-, smoking-, and drinking-adjusted OR 1.601, 95% CI 1.078-2.379, p = 0.020). However, for females, ALDH2*2/*2 genotype was a protective factor for cerebral infarction in the co-dominant model (age-, smoking-, and drinking-adjusted OR 0.450 95% CI 0.215-0.941, p = 0.034) and the recessive model (age-, smoking-, and drinking-adjusted OR 0.440, 95% CI 0.214-0.903, p = 0.025). Further, logistic regression analysis revealed that age, smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypercholesterolemia were significant risks for the presence of cerebral infarction. In conclusion, these findings support an association of ALDH2 gene polymorphisms with ischemic stroke in a Chinese Hakka population.

A Cox proportional hazards model was conducted to estimate the effects of self-reported alcohol consumption. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed to explore the causality using rs671 as an instrumental variable., RESULTS: During the follow-up of 303,353 person-years, 2406 incident CVDs and 3195 all-cause mortalities were identified. J-shaped associations of self-reported alcohol consumption with incident CVD and all-cause mortality were observed, showing decreased risks for light (<=25 g/d) and moderate drinkers (25-<=60 g/d). However, MR analyses revealed a linear association of genetically predicted alcohol consumption with the incident CVD (P-trend = 0.02), including both CAD (P-trend = 0.03) and stroke (P-trend = 0.02). The HRs (95% CIs) for incident CVD across increasing tertiles of genetically predicted alcohol consumption were 1 (reference), 1.18 (1.01, 1.38), and 1.22 (1.03, 1.46). After excluding heavy drinkers, the risk of incident CVD and all-cause mortality was increased by 27% and 20% per standard drink increment of genetically predicted alcohol consumption, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses extend the evidence of the harmful effect of alcohol consumption to total CVD (including CAD) and all-cause mortality, highlighting the potential health benefits of lowering alcohol consumption, even among light-to-moderate male drinkers.

However, studies on the association between HHcy combined with MS and stroke risk in hypertensive patients were absent. MATERIAL AND METHODS In 14 059 selected participants with elevated blood pressure, we assessed the prevalence of the MS and stroke. We defined HHcy as plasma total homocysteine >15 mumol/L. MS was defined according to the Chinese Diabetes Society (CDS) criterion. Multivariable analysis was used to examine the association of HHcy or (and) MS with stroke risk in different models. RESULTS The prevalence rates of HHcy and MS were 49.96% and 42.21%, respectively. Patients with stroke had higher plasma total homocysteine levels and a higher prevalence of MS (P<0.001). Multivariable analyses indicated that HHcy and MS are independently associated with higher prevalence of stroke (adjusted-odds ratio (OR): 1.36, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.58, P<0.001; adjusted-OR: 1.68, 95% CI 1.44 to 1.96, P<0.001, respectively).

Previous genome-wide association studies identified 51 loci associated with stroke (mostly ischemic) and its subtypes among predominantly European populations. Using whole-genome sequencing in ancestrally diverse populations from the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program, we aimed to identify novel variants, especially low-frequency or ancestry-specific variants, associated with all stroke, ischemic stroke and its subtypes (large artery, cardioembolic, and small vessel), and hemorrhagic stroke and its subtypes (intracerebral and subarachnoid)., METHODS: Whole-genome sequencing data were available for 6833 stroke cases and 27 116 controls, including 22 315 European, 7877 Black, 2616 Hispanic/Latino, 850 Asian, 54 Native American, and 237 other ancestry participants. In TOPMed, we performed single variant association analysis examining 40 million common variants and aggregated association analysis focusing on rare variants. We also combined TOPMed European populations with over 28 000 additional European participants from the UK BioBank genome-wide array data through meta-analysis., RESULTS: In the single variant association analysis in TOPMed, we identified one novel locus 13q33 for large artery at whole-genome-wide significance (P<5.00x10-9) and 4 novel loci at genome-wide significance (P<5.00x10-8), all of which need confirmation in independent studies. Lead variants in all 5 loci are low-frequency but are more common in non-European populations. An aggregation of synonymous rare variants within the gene C6orf26 demonstrated suggestive evidence of association for hemorrhagic stroke (P<3.11x10-6). By meta-analyzing European ancestry samples in TOPMed and UK BioBank, we replicated several previously reported stroke loci including PITX2, HDAC9, ZFHX3, and LRCH1., CONCLUSIONS: We represent the first association analysis for stroke and its subtypes using whole-genome sequencing data from ancestrally diverse populations. While our findings suggest the potential benefits of combining whole-genome sequencing data with populations of diverse genetic backgrounds to identify possible low-frequency or ancestry-specific variants, they also highlight the need to increase genome coverage and sample sizes.","Authors":"Hu, Yao; Haessler, Jeffrey W.; Manansala, Regina; Wiggins, Kerri L.; Moscati, Arden; Beiser, Alexa; Heard-Costa, Nancy L.; Sarnowski, Chloe; Raffield, Laura M.; Chung, Jaeyoon; Marini, Sandro; Anderson, Christopher D.; Rosand, Jonathan; Xu, Huichun; Sun, Xiao; Kelly, Tanika N.; Wong, Quenna; Lange, Leslie A.; Rotter, Jerome I.; Correa, Adolfo; Vasan, Ramachandran S.; Seshadri, Sudha; Rich, Stephen S.; Do, Ron; Loos, Ruth J.

The present study aims to determine whether genetically predicted serum phosphate is causally associated with the distinct subtypes of cardiovascular events through the use of Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Method(s): Independent and strongly correlated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for serum phosphate were extracted from publicly available genome-wide association studies. Summary statistics of cardiovascular diseases were derived from large-scale consortiums, including HERMES and FinnGen biobank. MR-Egger, weighted median, inverse variance weighted, pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) methods and MR using robust adjusted profile score (MR-RAPS) were employed to analyze causality. The sensitivity analyses comprised heterogeneity, horizontal pleiotropy, and leave-one-out approaches; these were used to ensure the stability of the results. Result(s): Our study demonstrated that increased genetically predicted serum phosphate is causally associated with a higher risk of valvular heart disease (VHD) [For VHD including rheumatic fever: odds ratio (OR) = 2.45; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.52-3.94; p = 0.0002; for non-rheumatic VHD: OR = 6.58; 95% CI, 2.50-17.32; p = 0.0001]. However, no causal association was detected between serum phosphate and other common cardiovascular diseases (including coronary heart disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and essential hypertension). Conclusion(s): The results indicate strong causality between serum phosphate and valvular heart disease. Serum phosphate-lowering therapy within the physiological range may represent a novel therapeutic method for valvular heart disease.Copyright © 2022 Huang, Zhang, Gong, Gao, Xie and Jiang.","Authors":"Huang, J.; Zhang, C.; Gong, Q.; Gao, Y.; Xie, X.; Jiang, J.","Publisher":"Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine","Issue":"Not Available","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fcvm.2022.973338","Pages":"973338","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"MR genetically predicted serum phosphate"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":4,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":3,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":13,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":15,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":16,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":19,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":42,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":47,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":49,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":54,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":1437,"Title":"The Interplay Between Titin, Polygenic Risk, and Modifiable Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation","Year":2021,"Country":"","Abstract":"Background: Common and rare variants, including those in the gene for the cardiac structural protein titin (TTN), have been implicated in the risk of developing atrial fibrillation (AF). However, the effect of genetic variants on risk of AF compared with established modifiable risk factors is unclear. The objective of this study was to evaluate the risk of AF and associated cardiovascular complications in TTN variant carriers and examine interactions between TTN variants or common variants and modifiable AF risk factors. Method(s): We used whole exome sequencing data of 49,881 individuals and genotyping data of 408,572 individuals from the UK Biobank to examine the associations of TTN variants, polygenic risk, and 4 risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and smoking) with AF.

Using power-adjusted transferability ratios, we found evidence for transferability for the majority of cardiometabolic loci powered to replicate. The performance of polygenic scores was high for lipids and blood pressure, but lower for BMI and coronary artery disease. Adding a polygenic score for coronary artery disease to clinical risk factors showed significant improvement in reclassification.

The primary aim is to assess CAC as a risk classifier in stable coronary artery disease (CAD)., HYPOTHESIS: CAC improves CAD risk prediction, compared to conventional risk scoring, even in the absence of cardiovascular risk factor inputs., METHODS: Outpatients presenting to a cardiology clinic (n = 3518) were divided into two cohorts: derivation (n = 2344 patients) and validation (n = 1174 patients). Adding logarithmic transformation of CAC, we built two logistic regression models: Model 1 with chest pain history and risk factors and Model 2 including chest pain history only without risk factors simulating patients with undiagnosed comorbidities. The CAD I Consortium Score (CCS) was the conventional reference risk score used. The primary outcome was the presence of coronary artery disease defined as any epicardial artery stenosis>=50% on CT coronary angiogram., RESULTS: Area under curve (AUC) of CCS in our validation cohort was 0.80. The AUC of Models 1 and 2 were significantly improved at 0.88 (95%CI 0.86-0.91) and 0.87 (95%CI 0.84-0.90), respectively. Integrated discriminant improvement was >15% for both models.

As the most common pathological process, atherosclerosis leads to metabolic syndrome (MetS)-related ischaemic stroke (IS) and myocardial infarction. Hypothesizing that polymorphisms of the PLCL2 gene might be associated with the onset and prognosis of IS in MetS patients, we performed the following study in a Chinese Han population. A total of 709 cases (patients with MetS plus IS) and 711 controls (patients with MetS) were enrolled. A fine-mapping strategy was adopted to identify tagged single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the PLCL2 gene, and improved multiplex ligation detection reaction (iMLDR) technology was used to genotype the selected SNPs. Logistic regression was used to analyse the values of the selected SNPs for the risk of IS between the cases and controls, adjusting for sex, age, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, hyperglycaemia, smoking and drinking. To compare the mean age of IS onset among different risk score groups, a genetic risk score was constructed for each case. The cumulative risk of IS events in the case group was presented using a cumulative incidence curve. All cases were followed up for 3 months, and functional outcomes were recorded prospectively. Two SNPs (rs4685423 and rs4618210) were significantly related to the risk of IS in MetS patients. For rs4685423, patients who were AA homozygotes were less likely to suffer from IS than C-allele carriers (OR 0.718; 95% CI 0.567-0.909; multivariate-adjusted, P = 0.006). For rs4618210, A-allele carriers were less likely to develop IS than patients who were GG homozygotes (OR 0.679; 95% CI 0.548-0.841; multivariate-adjusted, P < 0.001). As the genetic risk score increased, the mean age at IS onset decreased (log-rank P = 0.010). There was no statistically significant difference in the distribution of the 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) outcomes across the rs4685423 (P = 0.319) or rs4618210 polymorphisms (P = 0.148). Our findings suggested that genetic polymorphisms of PLCL2 might be associated with the onset of MetS-related IS. Further studies are warranted to validate our findings in other ethnic populations.Copyright © 2022 Huang, Ye, Zhang, Chen, Li, Sun and Ye.","Authors":"Huang, X.; Ye, Q.; Zhang, Y.; Chen, Y.; Li, J.; Sun, J.; Ye, Z.","Publisher":"Frontiers in Neurology","Issue":"Not Available","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2021.743169","Pages":"743169","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"PLCL2 variants"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":42,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":47,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":58,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":1453,"Title":"Sexual Differences in Genetic Predisposition of Coronary Artery Disease","Year":2021,"Country":"","Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The genomic structure that contributes to the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) can be evaluated as a risk score of multiple variants.

Oculomics of retinal vascular features (RVFs) extracted from retinal fundus images can reflect systemic vascular properties and therefore were hypothesized to provide valuable information on detecting the risk of aneurysms. By integrating oculomics with genomics, this study aimed to (i) identify predictive RVFs as imaging biomarkers for aneurysms and (ii) evaluate the value of these RVFs in supporting early detection of aneurysms in the context of predictive, preventive and personalized medicine (PPPM). Method(s): This study involved 51,597 UK Biobank participants who had retinal images available to extract oculomics of RVFs. Phenome-wide association analyses (PheWASs) were conducted to identify RVFs associated with the genetic risks of the main types of aneurysms, including abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), thoracic aneurysm (TAA), intracranial aneurysm (ICA) and Marfan syndrome (MFS). An aneurysm-RVF model was then developed to predict future aneurysms. The performance of the model was assessed in both derivation and validation cohorts and was compared with other models employing clinical risk factors. An RVF risk score was derived from our aneurysm-RVF model to identify patients with an increased risk of aneurysms. Result(s): PheWAS identified a total of 32 RVFs that were significantly associated with the genetic risks of aneurysms. Of these, the number of vessels in the optic disc ('ntreeA') was associated with both AAA (beta = -0.36, P = 6.75e-10) and ICA (beta = -0.11, P = 5.51e-06). In addition, the mean angles between each artery branch ('curveangle_mean_a') were commonly associated with 4 MFS genes (FBN1: beta = -0.10, P = 1.63e-12; COL16A1: beta = -0.07, P = 3.14e-09; LOC105373592: beta = -0.06, P = 1.89e-05; C8orf81/LOC441376: beta = 0.07, P = 1.02e-05). The developed aneurysm-RVF model showed good discrimination ability in predicting the risks of aneurysms. In the derivation cohort, the C-index of the aneurysm-RVF model was 0.809 [95% CI: 0.780-0.838], which was similar to the clinical risk model (0.806 [0.778-0.834]) but higher than the baseline model (0.739 [0.733-0.746]). Similar performance was observed in the validation cohort, with a C-index of 0.798 (0.727-0.869) for the aneurysm-RVF model, 0.795 (0.718-0.871) for the clinical risk model and 0.719 (0.620-0.816) for the baseline model. An aneurysm risk score was derived from the aneurysm-RVF model for each study participant. The individuals in the upper tertile of the aneurysm risk score had a significantly higher risk of aneurysm compared to those in the lower tertile (hazard ratio = 17.8 [6.5-48.8], P = 1.02e-05). Conclusion(s): We identified a significant association between certain RVFs and the risk of aneurysms and revealed the impressive capability of using RVFs to predict the future risk of aneurysms by a PPPM approach. Our finds have great potential to support not only the predictive diagnosis of aneurysms but also a preventive and more personalized screening plan which may benefit both patients and the healthcare system.

Methods and Results: Using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we conducted the two-sample MR to assess the effects of VAT mass on 10 metabolic risk factors and 53 CVD endpoints. Genetically predicted VAT mass was associated with metabolic risk factors, including triglyceride (odds ratio, OR, 1.263 [95% confidence interval, CI, 1.203-1.326]), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (OR, 0.719 [95% CI, 0.678-0.763]), type 2 diabetes (OR, 2.397 [95% CI, 1.965-2.923]), fasting glucose (OR, 1.079 [95% CI, 1.046-1.113]), fasting insulin (OR, 1.194 [95% CI, 1.16-1.229]), and insulin resistance (OR, 1.204 [95% CI, 1.16-1.25]).

In the FinnGen study, the relevance of VAT mass to coronary heart disease, stroke, cardiac arrhythmia, vascular diseases, hypertensive heart disease, and cardiac death was found. In network analysis to identify the underlying mechanism between VAT and CVDs, VAT mass was positively associated with 23 cardiovascular-related proteins (e.g., Leptin, Hepatocyte growth factor, interleukin-16), and inversely with 6 proteins (e.g., Galanin peptides, Endothelial cell-specific molecule 1). These proteins were further associated with 32 CVD outcomes. Conclusion(s): Mendelian randomization analysis has shown that VAT mass was associated with a wide range of CVD outcomes including coronary heart disease, cardiac arrhythmia, vascular diseases, and stroke.

NAFLD was defined on CT images as a liver:spleen attenuation ratio < 1.0. Cardiovascular events were defined as cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, late coronary revascularization, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure., RESULTS: Among 529 patients (61% men, mean age 65 years), NAFLD was identified in 143 (27%).

Given the finite resources, it is important to identify individuals who would receive the most benefit from detecting positive CAC by screening. However, the evidence is limited as to whether the burden of positive CAC on CVD differs by multidimensional individual characteristics. We sought to investigate the heterogeneity in the association between positive CAC and incident CVD., METHODS: This cohort study included adults from MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) ages >=45 years and free of cardiovascular disease. After propensity score matching in a 1:1 ratio, we applied a machine learning causal forest model to (1) evaluate the heterogeneity in the association between positive CAC and incident CVD, and (2) predict the increase in CVD risk at 10-years when CAC>0 (versus CAC=0) at the individual level. We then compared the estimated increase in CVD risk when CAC>0 to the absolute 10-year atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) risk calculated by the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association pooled cohort equations., RESULTS: Across 3328 adults in our propensity score-matched analysis, our causal forest model showed the heterogeneity in the association between CAC>0 and incident CVD. We found a dose-response relationship of the estimated increase in CVD risk when CAC>0 with higher 10-year ASCVD risk. Almost all individuals (2293 of 2428 [94.4%]) with borderline risk of ASCVD or higher showed >=2.5% increase in CVD risk when CAC>0. Even among 900 adults with low ASCVD risk, 689 (69.2%) showed >=2.5% increase in CVD risk when CAC>0; these individuals were more likely to be male, Hispanic, and have unfavorable CVD risk factors than others., CONCLUSIONS: The expected increases in CVD risk when CAC>0 were heterogeneous across individuals. Moreover, nearly 70% of people with low ASCVD risk showed a large increase in CVD risk when CAC>0, highlighting the need for CAC screening among such low-risk individuals. Future studies are needed to assess whether targeting individuals for CAC measurements based on not only the absolute ASCVD risk but also the expected increase in CVD risk when CAC>0 improves cardiovascular outcomes.","Authors":"Inoue, Kosuke; Seeman, Teresa E.; Horwich, Tamara; Budoff, Matthew J.; Watson, Karol E.","Publisher":"Circulation","Issue":"2","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.062626","Pages":"132-141","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"coronary artery calcium (CAC) > 0"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":42,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":46,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":49,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":1517,"Title":"Highly elevated polygenic risk scores are better predictors of myocardial infarction risk early in life than later","Year":2021,"Country":"","Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Several polygenic risk scores (PRS) have been developed for cardiovascular risk prediction, but the additive value of including PRS together with conventional risk factors for risk prediction is questionable.

However, whether those associations reflect causal links or can be attributed to confounding is still not fully clear. We investigated causal effects of copper on the risk of cardiometabolic endpoints (stroke, coronary artery disease [CAD] and type 2 diabetes) and cardiometabolic risk factors in two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) studies. The selection of genetic instruments for blood copper levels relied on meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies in three independent studies (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Potsdam study, Prospective investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors study, Queensland Institute of Medical Research studies). For the selected instruments, outcome associations were drawn from large public genetic consortia on the respective disease endpoints (MEGASTROKE, Cardiogram, DIAGRAM) and cardiometabolic risk factors. MR results indicate an inverse association for genetically higher copper levels with risk of CAD (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 0.92 [0.86-0.99], P = 0.022) and systolic blood pressure (beta [standard error (SE)] = -0.238 [0.121]; P = 0.049). Multivariable MR incorporating copper and systolic blood pressure into one model suggested systolic blood pressure as mediating factor between copper and CAD risk. In contrast to previous observational evidence establishing higher blood copper levels as risk-increasing factor for cardiometabolic diseases, this study suggests that higher levels of genetically predicted copper might play a protective role for the development of CAD and systolic blood pressure.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

The prevalence of CHD is increasing day by day in India. The hardening of arteries is linked to oxidative variations in low-density lipoproteins (LDLs). Modification of LDL to oxidized LDL (ox-LDL) is a crucial step in the oxidation hypothesis of atherogenesis. Oxidized LDL and remnant lipoprotein cholesterol (RLP-C) stimulate the immune and inflammatory reactions and promote atherosclerosis. Because of its lesser size along with high cholesterol content, and increased residence period in blood the remnant lipoproteins are highly atherogenic. Remnant lipoproteins transport more cholesterol to macrophages compared to LDL particles. Remnant lipoproteins enter into the arterial wall easily and are taken up directly by macrophages. This leads to the formation of foam cells, thus initiating the lipid-laden plaque. High sensitive C-reactive protein acts as a nonspecific inflammatory marker. Oxidized LDL along with RLP-C and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) play crucial role in progression of CHD., AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of the study is to assess ox-LDL and RLP-C associated with hs-CRP as potential biomarkers in the development of CHD., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Sri Ramaswamy Memorial Medical College Hospital and Research Centre on subjects appearing for master health check-up and medicine. This cross-sectional study was conducted on 273 subjects who were age and sex match in the age group of <=45 years. 91 Non-Diabetic subjects with CHD, 91 Diabetic subjects with CHD, and 91 normal healthy subjects were selected as control. After overnight fasting, body fluid samples were collected for analysis for lipid profile, ox-LDL, and hs-CRP. Oxidized LDL and hs-CRP were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method and lipid profile was measured using Auto Analyser AU480. Statistical analysis was done using Student's t-test and Pearson's correlation analysis for the comparison between two groups., RESULTS: The mean level of ox-LDL, RLP-C, and hs-CRP was significantly elevated in CHD group. A significantly positive correlation was observed between plasma ox-LDL, RLP-C, and hs-CRP., CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the link between high ox-LDL, RLP-C, and hs-CRP levels might be interrelated to atherogenesis in subjects with CHD. In addition to conventional parameters, ox-LDL, RLP-C, and hs-CRP can prove to be a valuable tool in risk assessment of CHD.

Therefore, we conducted Mendelian Randomization approaches to investigate the causal relationship between classical risk factors and primary CAD in different age groups. A Mendelian Randomization study was conducted in European-ethnicity individuals from the UK Biobank population. Analyses were performed using data of 22,313 CAD cases (71.6% men) and 407,920 controls (44.5% men). Using logistic regression analyses, we investigated the associations between standardized genetic risk score and primary CAD stratified by age of diagnosis. In addition, feature importance and model accuracy were assessed in different age groups to evaluate predictive power of the genetic risk scores with increasing age. We found age-dependent associations for all classical CAD risk factors. Notably, body mass index (OR 1.22 diagnosis < 50 years; OR 1.02 diagnosis > 70 years), blood pressure (OR 1.12 < 50 years; OR 1.04 > 70 years), LDL cholesterol (OR 1.16 < 50 years; OR 1.02 > 70 years), and triglyceride levels (OR 1.11 < 50 years; 1.04 > 70 years). In line with the Mendelian Randomization analyses, model accuracy and feature importance of the classical risk factors decreased with increasing age of diagnosis. Causal determinants for primary CAD are age dependent with classical CAD risk factors attenuating in relation with primary CAD with increasing age. These results question the need for (some) currently applied cardiovascular disease risk reducing interventions at older age. Copyright © 2021.

Central to this are disorders of lipoprotein metabolism. Apolipoprotein B (Apo B) and Apolipoprotein A1 (Apo A1) are structural and functional components of lipoprotein particles that serve as transporters of cholesterol. Apo B and Apo A1 are among the emerging markers for Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD). Routine conventional lipid profile does not incorporate these markers. Aim(s): To determine the level of Apo A1 and Apo B in patients of IHD with or without Type II Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and analyse the significance of these parameters over the conventional lipid profile. Material(s) and Method(s): The case-control study was conducted at Government Medical College, Bhavnagar, Gujarat, India from July 2013 to December 2013. The study consists of 100 participants including 50 having IHD only (Group I), 50 having IHD with T2DM (Group II) as study groups and 50 healthy individuals (Group III) as control. Various biochemical parameters including Apo B and Apo A1 were analysed and statistically evaluated to come to conclusion. Result(s): The demographic details of the participants which shows no significant different in age and gender among Groups I, II and III. Apo B and A1 were elevated in Group I and II and were found highly significant (p-value<0.0001) as compared to the Group III. There was positive correlation of serum Apo B levels with total cholesterol (r=0.495, p-value<0.0001), Low-Density Lipoproteins (LDL-C) (r=0.526, p-value<0.0001) and Apo A1 (r=0.685, p-value<0.0001) in Group I and LDL-C (r=0.468, p-value=0.001) and Apo A1 (r=0.754, p-value<0.0001) in Group II. Similarly, Apo A1 levels were positively correlated with Apo B (r=0.685, p<0.0001) in Group I and LDL-C (r=0.305, p-value=0.031) and Apo B (r=0.754, p-value<0.0001) in Group II. Conclusion(s): As the Apo B and Apo A1 cover both atherogenic and antiatherogenic lipid parameters respectively, it can be used as a better predictor of development of IHD with and without T2DM in comparison to conventional parameters of lipid profile.Copyright © 2021 Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

We examined the association between alanine aminotransferase levels and long-term absolute risks of morbidity and mortality in healthy Danish people aged 30-49 years. Patients and Methods: We divided 671 healthy participants from the Ebeltoft Health Promotion Project into four categories based on their baseline alanine aminotransferase values: low (<=10U/l), medium-low (men: 11-34U/l, women: 11-22U/l), medium-high (men: 35-69U/l, women: 23-44U/l) and high (men: >=70U/l, women: >=45U/l), and followed them through Danish healthcare registries for up to 20 years. We examined mortality and absolute risks of liver disease, overall cancer, ischemic heart disease, and diabetes. Result(s): The risk of any cancer was highest for participants with \"low alanine aminotransferase\" or \"high alanine aminotransferase\" (20-year risk: 17.2% [95% confidence interval (CI): 6.3-32.7%] and 18.2% [95% CI: 5.7-36.3%], respectively). The risk of diabetes was highest for participants with \"medium-high alanine aminotransferase\" or \"high alanine aminotransferase\" (20-year risk: 12.1% [95% CI: 7.3-18.3%] and 9.1% [95% CI: 1.6--25.1%], respectively). Participants with \"high alanine aminotransferase\" had the highest 20-year risk of liver disease (20-year risk: 13.6% [95% CI: 3.4-30.9%], while it was 1.0% or less in the other groups). The chance of being alive after 20 years without having been diagnosed with liver disease, cancer, ischemic heart disease, or diabetes was lowest in the \"high alanine aminotransferase\" group (50% [95% CI: 28-68%]) and 72-79% in the other groups.

We aimed to evaluate the association between IL-32 levels and coronary stenosis severity, IL-32 polymorphisms rs28372698 and rs4786370, and CAD susceptibility., METHODS: A total of 362 patients with definite or suspected CAD that underwent angiography were recruited (CAD group, n = 175; nonobstructive CAD group, n = 56; control group, n = 131). The severity of coronary stenosis was assessed using the Gensini score and the number of diseased vessels. IL-32 levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Gene polymorphisms were genotyped using PCR and sequencing techniques., RESULTS: IL-32 levels were significantly different at different levels of coronary artery stenosis (p < 0.05), and logIL-32 was positively correlated with the Gensini score (r = 0.357, p < 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that IL-32 was independently associated with CAD (OR = 6.526, 95% CI: 3.344-12.739, p < 0.01). The receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed the area under the curve for discriminating the CAD and Gensini score were 0.605 and 0.613, respectively. Furthermore, IL-32 levels were significantly higher before percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) than at 7 days post-PCI (p = 0.012). The homozygous TT genotype and T allele of rs28372698 were found to be associated with increased risk of CAD, while TT homozygosity and the T allele of rs4786370 with reduced risk of CAD (p < 0.05). However, both SNPs had no obvious effect on IL-32 levels or coronary stenosis severity in patients with CAD., CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to show that rs28372698 and rs4786370 are associated with CAD susceptibility in Chinese Han population. We also suggest that plasma IL-32 levels may be indicative of coronary artery stenosis and the efficacy of PCI and provide guidance for risk stratification and disease management.

We analyzed inflammatory markers and other risk factors for heart disease in 761 patients who participated in the CARDIPP-study, Cardiovascular Risk factors in Patients with Diabetes-a Prospective study in Primary care. All participants had type 2 diabetes and were 55-66 years old at recruitment during the years 2005-2008. Patients were followed for incidence of stroke, myocardial infarction, or death from cardiovascular disease until the end of the year 2018 using the national Swedish Cause of Death and Hospitalization Registries. Besides traditional risk-markers for vascular disease, we also measured carotid-femoral pulse-wave velocity and intima-media thickness of carotid arteries. During a median period of 13 years, 165 men and 65 women died or were hospitalized for ischemic heart disease and stroke. TNFrII showed statistically significance as a risk factor for stroke, ischemic heart disease, and total mortality in male patients with diabetes type 2, independently of age, diabetes duration, BMI, Hba1c, systolic blood pressure, triglycerides, IMT and PWV (p = 0.002, HR 2.70, CI 1.42:5.13, p = 0.002). Circulating TNFrII levels failed to present a similar correlation in women (p = 0.48, CI 0.48:4.84). TNFrII stayed significant in males when HDL/LDL-ratio, CRP and smoking were added to the statistical analysis. Our data support the use of serum TNFrII in male type 2 diabetes patients to add independent prognostic information in terms of mortality and heart disease independently of other strong and well-established risk markers including cholesterol, inflammatory cytokines, PWV and IMT.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01049737.

However, screening programmes have focused primarily on large (aneurysmal) aortas. In addition, aortic diameter is rarely adjusted for body size, which is particularly important for women. This study aimed to investigate specifically the relationship between body size adjusted infrarenal aortic diameter and baseline prevalence of CVD., METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on a total of 4882 elderly (>50 years) participants (mean age 69.4 +/- 8.9 years) for whom duplex ultrasound to assess infrarenal abdominal aortic diameters had been performed. History of CVDs, including ischaemic heart disease (IHD), and associated risk factors were collected at the time of assessment. A derivation cohort of 1668 participants was used to select cut offs at the lower and upper 12.5% tails of the aortic size distributions (aortic size index of <0.84 and >1.2, respectively), which was then tested in a separate cohort., RESULTS: A significantly elevated prevalence of CVD, and specifically IHD, was observed in participants with both small and large aortas. These associations remained significant following adjustment for age, sex, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, obesity (body mass index), and smoking., CONCLUSION: The largest and smallest infrarenal aortic sizes were both associated with prevalence of IHD. In addition to identifying those with aneurysmal disease, it is hypothesised that screening programmes examining infrarenal aortic size may also have the potential to improve global CVD risk prediction by identifying those with small aortas.

Then, 5 selected serum metabolites were quantified from the WP cohort, Shinchon cohort (n = 259), and Shinchon case control (n = 424) groups to develop machine learning models for 10-year risk prediction, relapse within 10 years and diagnosis of the disease via 100 repeated 5-fold cross-validations of logistic models. The combination of purine metabolite levels or only xanthine levels in blood could be applied for machine learning model development for major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular event (MACCE, cerebrovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, coronary artery bypass graft, and stroke) risk prediction, relapse of MACCEs among patients with myocardial infarction history and diagnosis of stable CAD. In particular, our research provided initial evidence that blood xanthine and uric acid levels play different roles in the development of machine learning models for primary/secondary prevention or diagnosis of CAD. In this research, we determined that purine-related metabolites in blood are applicable to machine learning model development for CAD risk prediction and diagnosis. Also, our work advances current CAD biomarker discovery strategies mainly relying on clinical features; emphasizes the differential biomarkers in first/secondary prevention or diagnosis studies.Copyright © 2021","Authors":"Jung, S.; Ahn, E.; Koh, S.

In the present cross-sectional study, we investigated whether the plasma nesfatin-1 and DPP4 is associated with the prevalence and severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) with and without diabetes mellitus (DM)., METHODS: We consecutively enrolled a total of 240 patients with significant CAD (previous revascularization or angiographically-proven coronary artery stenosis > 50%) presented with either unstable angina (UA, N = 76) or stable chronic CAD (SCAD, N = 165). 85 patients with at least 2 classical cardiovascular risk factors but without significant CAD served as controls. The severity of CAD was assessed using coronary angiography by the Gensini score. Clinical parameters, glycemic and lipid profile, high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP), nesfatin-1 and DPP4 levels were assayed., RESULTS: No differences were found for age, sex, hypertension and diabetes distribution between groups. Low nesfatin-1 levels were found in both CAD groups (UA & SCAD) with respect to controls. The difference between UA and SCAD groups was marginally non-significant. There was a significant increase of DPP4 along UA to SCAD and control groups. Differences between groups remained unchanged in non-diabetic participants. Nesfatin-1 significantly correlated to hsCRP (r = - 0.287, p = 0.036), HOMA-IR (r = - 0.587, p = 0.007) and hyperlipidemia (r = - 0.331, p = 0.034). DPP4 was significantly associated with hs-CRP (r = 0.353 p < 0.001) and FPG (r = 0.202, p = 0.020) in univariate analysis, but those correlations were lost in multiple regression analysis. There was a negative correlation between nesfatin-1 and the severity of CAD, quantified by the Gensini score (r = - 0.511, p < 0.001), but no association was found for DPP4., CONCLUSIONS: Serum DPP4 levels are increased in patients with CAD, while serum nesfatin-1 levels have a negative association with both the incidence and the severity of CAD. These results are independent of the presence of diabetes mellitus. In addition, both peptides have a strong association with hsCRP. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00306176.

Multiple risk factors, including both genetic and non-genetic components, as well as their interactions, are proposed as etiological factors involved in the development of ischemic stroke (IS). Promoter polymorphisms of the IL-6-174G/C (rs1800795) and TNF-alpha-308G/A (rs1800629) genes have been considered as predictive risk factors of IS; however, these have not yet been evaluated in a Thai population. The aims of this study were to investigate the association of IL-6-174G/C and TNF-alpha-308G/A polymorphisms with IS. Genomic DNA from 200 patients with IS and 200 controls were genotyped for IL-6-174G/C and TNF-alpha-308G/A polymorphisms using TaqManTM SNP genotyping and quantitative PCR-high resolution melting analysis, respectively. It was found that the TNF-alpha-308 A allele was significantly associated with an increased risk of IS development compared with the G allele [odds ratio (OR)=2.044; 95% CI=1.154-3.620; P=0.014]. Moreover, the IS risk was significantly higher in the presence of TNF-alpha-308 GA or AA genotypes compared with that in the presence of GG genotypes with a dominant inheritance (OR=1.971; 95% CI=1.080-3.599; P=0.027). However, there was no association between IL-6-174G/C and the risk of IS development. The interaction study demonstrated that IL-6-174 GG and TNF-alpha-308 GG genotypes enhanced IS susceptibility when combined with hypertension, hyperlipidemia and alcohol consumption. Hypertensive and hyperlipidemic subjects with the TNF-alpha-308 GA and AA genotypes were more likely to develop IS compared with those who did not have these two conditions and had the GG genotype. In a matched study design (1:1), the IL-6-174 GC genotype was associated with higher IL-6 levels in the control group. Collectively, the present results highlight the utility of the TNF-alpha-308G/A polymorphism as a predictive genetic risk factor for development of IS.Copyright © 2021, Spandidos Publications.

Methods and Results Summary statistical data for the genetic associations with the modifiable risk factors and the outcomes were obtained from meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies. The inverse-variance weighted method was used as the main Mendelian randomization analysis, with additional sensitivity analyses conducted using methods more robust to horizontal pleiotropy. Genetic predisposition to smoking, insomnia, and higher blood pressure was associated with an increased risk of both intracranial aneurysm and aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. For intracranial aneurysm, the odds ratios were 3.20 (95% CI, 1.93-5.29) per SD increase in smoking index, 1.24 (95% CI, 1.10-1.40) per unit increase in log-odds of insomnia, and 2.92 (95% CI, 2.49-3.43) per 10 mm Hg increase in diastolic blood pressure. In addition, there was weak evidence for associations of genetically predicted decreased physical activity, higher triglyceride levels, higher body mass index, and lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels with higher risk of intracranial aneurysm and aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, with 95% CI overlapping the null for at least 1 of the outcomes. All results were consistent in sensitivity analyses. Conclusions This Mendelian randomization study suggests that smoking, insomnia, and high blood pressure are major risk factors for intracranial aneurysm and aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.","Authors":"Karhunen, Ville; Bakker, Mark K.; Ruigrok, Ynte M.; Gill, Dipender; Larsson, Susanna C.","Publisher":"Journal of the American Heart Association","Issue":"22","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.121.022277","Pages":"e022277","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"MR genetically predicted insomnia"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":43,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":47,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":49,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":1675,"Title":"Common gene polymorphism in ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 and coronary artery disease: A genetic association study and a structural analysis","Year":2020,"Country":"","Abstract":"ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) has a crucial role in removing intracellular cholesterol and plays a protective role against atherosclerosis.

The c.1051 G > A genotyping was done by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. In the meta-analysis, eligible studies were collected from PubMed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect databases and pooled odds ratio, heterogeneity, publication bias, and sensitivity analyses were carried. Finally, some bioinformatics tools were employed to assess the impacts of p.R219K variation on ABCA1 protein structure. Our case-control examination showed a statistically significant association between c.1051 G > A genetic polymorphism and CAD risk. In addition, the meta-analysis showed reliable significant associations between c.1051 G > A transition and risk of CAD in the Caucasian population. In silico analysis showed that the p.R219K substitution could alter the secondary structure, hydrophobicity pattern, and Ramachandran plot of ABCA1.

Amongst the four major cardiovascular diseases, stroke is one of the most dangerous and life-threatening disease, but the life of a patient can be saved if the stroke is detected during early stage. The literature reveals that the patients always experience ministrokes which are also known as transient ischemic attacks (TIA) before experiencing the actual attack of the stroke. Most of the literature work is based on the MRI and CT scan images for classifying the cardiovascular diseases including a stroke which is an expensive approach for diagnosis of early strokes. In India where cases of strokes are rising, there is a need to explore noninvasive cheap methods for the diagnosis of early strokes. Hence, this problem has motivated us to conduct the study presented in this paper. A noninvasive approach for the early diagnosis of the strokes is proposed. The cascaded prediction algorithms are time-consuming in producing the results and cannot work on the raw data and without making use of the properties of EEG. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to devise mechanisms to forecast strokes on the basis of processed EEG data. This paper is proposing time series-based approaches such as LSTM, biLSTM, GRU, and FFNN that can handle time series-based predictions to make useful decisions. The experimental research outcome reveals that all the algorithms taken up for the research study perform well on the prediction problem of early stroke detection, but GRU performs the best with 95.6% accuracy, whereas biLSTM gives 91% accuracy and LSTM gives 87% accuracy and FFNN gives 83% accuracy. The experimental outcome is able to measure the brain waves to predict the signs of strokes. The findings can certainly assist the physicians to detect the stroke at early stages to save the lives of the patients.Copyright © 2022 Mandeep Kaur et al.","Authors":"Kaur, M.; Sakhare, S.

Although genetic factors are thought to play a role in this cerebrovascular condition, its genetic etiology is not well understood. Method(s): A genome-wide association study was performed to identify genetic variants influencing susceptibility to CVT. A 2-stage genome-wide study was undertaken in 882 Europeans diagnosed with CVT and 1,205 ethnicity-matched control subjects divided into discovery and independent replication datasets. Result(s): In the overall case-control cohort, we identified highly significant associations with 37 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the 9q34.2 region. The strongest association was with rs8176645 (combined p = 9.15 x 10-24; odds ratio [OR] = 2.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.76-2.31). The discovery set findings were validated across an independent European cohort. Genetic risk score for this 9q34.2 region increases CVT risk by a pooled estimate OR = 2.65 (95% CI = 2.21-3.20, p = 2.00 x 10-16). SNPs within this region were in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with coding regions of the ABO gene. The ABO blood group was determined using allele combination of SNPs rs8176746 and rs8176645. Blood groups A, B, or AB, were at 2.85 times (95% CI = 2.32-3.52, p = 2.00 x 10-16) increased risk of CVT compared with individuals with blood group O. Interpretation(s): We present the first chromosomal region to robustly associate with a genetic susceptibility to CVT. This region more than doubles the likelihood of CVT, a risk greater than any previously identified thrombophilia genetic risk marker. That the identified variant is in strong LD with the coding region of the ABO gene with differences in blood group prevalence provides important new insights into the pathophysiology of CVT.

Nevertheless, its reliability for contemporary UK T2D populations is unclear. We assessed the performance of version 2 of the model (UKPDS-OM2) using data from A Study of Cardiovascular Events in Diabetes (ASCEND), which followed participants with diabetes in the UK between 2005 and 2017., METHODS: The UKPDS-OM2 was used to predict the occurrence of myocardial infarction (MI), other ischemic heart disease, stroke, cardiovascular (CV) death, and other death among the 14 569 participants with T2D in ASCEND, all without previous CV disease at study entry. Calibration (comparison of predicted and observed year-on-year cumulative incidence over 10 years) and discrimination (c-statistics) of the model were assessed for each endpoint. The percentage error in event rates at year 7 (mean duration of follow up) was used to quantify model bias., RESULTS: The UKPDS-OM2 substantially overpredicted MI, stroke, CV death, and other death over the 10-year follow-up period (by 149%, 42%, 269%, and 52%, respectively, at year 7). Discrimination of the model for MI and other ischemic heart disease (c-statistics 0.58 and 0.60, respectively) was poorer than that for other outcomes (c-statistics ranging from 0.66 to 0.72)., CONCLUSIONS: The UKPDS-OM2 substantially overpredicted risks of key CV outcomes and death in people with T2D in ASCEND. Appropriate adjustments or a new model may be required for assessments of long-term effects of treatments in contemporary T2D cohorts.

Method(s): In this observational study, 709 men, free of stroke, were sampled from a city in Japan from 2010 to 2014. CAC was scored using the Agatston method. The following SCVDs were assessed using magnetic resonance imaging: intracranial arterial stenosis (ICAS), lacunar infarction, deep and subcortical white matter hyperintensity (DSWMH), periventricular hyperintensity (PVH), and microbleeds. The participants were categorized according to CAC scores as follows: no CAC (0), mild CAC (1-100), and moderate-to-severe CAC (100). The adjusted odds ratios of prevalent SCVDs were computed in reference to the no-CAC group using logistic regression. Result(s): The mean (standard deviation) age of the participants was 68 (8.4) years. Participants in the moderate-to-severe CAC category showed significantly higher odds of prevalent lacunar infarction, DSWMH, and ICAS in age-adjusted and risk-factor-adjusted models. Microbleeds and PVH, in contrast, did not show any significant associations. The trends for CAC with lacunar infarction, DSWMH, and ICAS were also significant (all P-values for trend <= 0.02).

Rare coding variants in the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene (LDLR) are identified in 1% to 2% of coronary artery disease (CAD) patients, defining a molecular subtype with risk driven by hypercholesterolemia., METHODS: To search for additional subtypes, we compared the frequency of rare, predicted loss-of-function and damaging missense variants aggregated within a given gene in 41 081 CAD cases versus 217 115 controls., RESULTS: Rare variants in LDLR were most strongly associated with CAD, present in 1% of cases and associated with 4.4-fold increased CAD risk. A second subtype was characterized by variants in endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene (NOS3), a key enzyme regulating vascular tone, endothelial function, and platelet aggregation. A rare predicted loss-of-function or damaging missense variants in NOS3 was present in 0.6% of cases and associated with 2.42-fold increased risk of CAD (95% CI, 1.80-3.26; P=5.50x10-9). These variants were associated with higher systolic blood pressure (+3.25 mm Hg; [95% CI, 1.86-4.65]; P=5.00x10-6) and increased risk of hypertension (adjusted odds ratio 1.31; [95% CI, 1.14-1.51]; P=2.00x10-4) but not circulating cholesterol concentrations, suggesting that, beyond lipid pathways, nitric oxide synthesis is a key nonlipid driver of CAD risk., CONCLUSIONS: Beyond LDLR, we identified an additional nonlipid molecular subtype of CAD characterized by rare variants in the NOS3 gene.","Authors":"Khera, Amit V.; Wang, Minxian; Chaffin, Mark; Emdin, Connor A.; Samani, Nilesh J.; Schunkert, Heribert; Watkins, Hugh; McPherson, Ruth; Erdmann, Jeanette; Elosua, Roberto; Boerwinkle, Eric; Ardissino, Diego; Butterworth, Adam S.; Di Angelantonio, Emanuele; Naheed, Aliya; Danesh, John; Chowdhury, Rajiv; Krumholz, Harlan M.; Sheu, Wayne H.

However, it remains unclear whether AI provides meaningful and generalizable improvement in predictive accuracy beyond clinical risk factors for AF. Method(s): We trained a convolutional neural network (ECG-AI) to infer 5-year incident AF risk using 12-lead ECGs in patients receiving longitudinal primary care at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). We then fit 3 Cox proportional hazards models, composed of ECG-AI 5-year AF probability, CHARGE-AF clinical risk score (Cohorts for Heart and Aging in Genomic Epidemiology-Atrial Fibrillation), and terms for both ECG-AI and CHARGE-AF (CH-AI), respectively. We assessed model performance by calculating discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) and calibration in an internal test set and 2 external test sets (Brigham and Women's Hospital [BWH] and UK Biobank). Models were recalibrated to estimate 2-year AF risk in the UK Biobank given limited available follow-up. We used saliency mapping to identify ECG features most influential on ECG-AI risk predictions and assessed correlation between ECG-AI and CHARGE-AF linear predictors. Result(s): The training set comprised 45 770 individuals (age 55+/-17 years, 53% women, 2171 AF events) and the test sets comprised 83 162 individuals (age 59+/-13 years, 56% women, 2424 AF events). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was comparable using CHARGE-AF (MGH, 0.802 [95% CI, 0.767-0.836]; BWH, 0.752 [95% CI, 0.741-0.763]; UK Biobank, 0.732 [95% CI, 0.704-0.759]) and ECG-AI (MGH, 0.823 [95% CI, 0.790-0.856]; BWH, 0.747 [95% CI, 0.736-0.759]; UK Biobank, 0.705 [95% CI, 0.673-0.737]). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was highest using CH-AI (MGH, 0.838 [95% CI, 0.807 to 0.869]; BWH, 0.777 [95% CI, 0.766 to 0.788]; UK Biobank, 0.746 [95% CI, 0.716 to 0.776]). Calibration error was low using ECG-AI (MGH, 0.0212; BWH, 0.0129; UK Biobank, 0.0035) and CH-AI (MGH, 0.012; BWH, 0.0108; UK Biobank, 0.0001). In saliency analyses, the ECG P-wave had the greatest influence on AI model predictions. ECG-AI and CHARGE-AF linear predictors were correlated (Pearson r: MGH, 0.61; BWH, 0.66; UK Biobank, 0.41). Conclusion(s): AI-based analysis of 12-lead ECGs has similar predictive usefulness to a clinical risk factor model for incident AF and the approaches are complementary.

Electronic health record (EHR)-based AF risk prediction may facilitate efficient deployment of interventions to diagnose or prevent AF altogether., METHODS: We externally validated an electronic health record AF (EHR-AF) score in IBM Explorys Life Sciences, a multi-institutional dataset containing statistically deidentified EHR data for over 21 million individuals (Explorys Dataset). We included individuals with complete AF risk data, >=2 office visits within 2 years, and no prevalent AF. We compared EHR-AF to existing scores including CHARGE-AF (Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology Atrial Fibrillation), C2HEST (coronary artery disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, elderly, systolic heart failure, thyroid disease), and CHA2DS2-VASc. We assessed association between AF risk scores and 5-year incident AF, stroke, and heart failure using Cox proportional hazards modeling, 5-year AF discrimination using C indices, and calibration of predicted AF risk to observed AF incidence., RESULTS: Of 21 825 853 individuals in the Explorys Dataset, 4 508 180 comprised the analysis (age 62.5, 56.3% female). AF risk scores were strongly associated with 5-year incident AF (hazard ratio per SD increase 1.85 using CHA2DS2-VASc to 2.88 using EHR-AF), stroke (1.61 using C2HEST to 1.92 using CHARGE-AF), and heart failure (1.91 using CHA2DS2-VASc to 2.58 using EHR-AF). EHR-AF (C index, 0.808 [95% CI, 0.807-0.809]) demonstrated favorable AF discrimination compared to CHARGE-AF (0.806 [95% CI, 0.805-0.807]), C2HEST (0.683 [95% CI, 0.682-0.684]), and CHA2DS2-VASc (0.720 [95% CI, 0.719-0.722]). Of the scores, EHR-AF demonstrated the best calibration to incident AF (calibration slope, 1.002 [95% CI, 0.997-1.007]). In subgroup analyses, AF discrimination using EHR-AF was lower in individuals with stroke (C index, 0.696 [95% CI, 0.692-0.700]) and heart failure (0.621 [95% CI, 0.617-0.625])., CONCLUSIONS: EHR-AF demonstrates predictive accuracy for incident AF using readily ascertained EHR data. AF risk is associated with incident stroke and heart failure.

We compared the utility of age, CHARGE-AF, and Predict-AF for predicting 5-year AF by quantifying discrimination and calibration., RESULTS: Among 543 093 individuals, 8940 developed AF within 5 years. In the validation sets, CHARGE-AF (C index range, 0.720-0.824) and Predict-AF (0.749-0.831) had largely comparable discrimination, both favorable to continuous age (0.675-0.801).

Participants and Methods: We included 284,767 white British participants of UK Biobank without genetic relatedness and stroke or myocardial infarction at baseline between March 13, 2006, and October 1, 2010. Genetic risk was assessed with polygenic risk scores, calculated by summing the risk-increasing alleles, weighted by the effect estimates. Muscle strength was assessed through grip strength tests by hand dynamometers. Incidence of overall (n= 4008), ischemic (n= 3031), and hemorrhagic (n=1073) stroke was adjudicated during 11.5-year follow-up. Result(s): Compared with the bottom muscle strength tertile, hazard ratios (95% CI) of stroke were 0.81 (0.75 to 0.87) and 0.76 (0.71 to 0.82) for the middle and top muscle strength tertiles, respectively, after adjustment for confounders and genetic risk; higher genetic risk was independently associated with higher stroke incidence. Stroke hazards for the top muscle strength tertile were consistently lower across genetic risk strata, with no evidence of interaction. Compared with individuals with high muscle strength and low genetic risk, stroke hazards were higher for individuals who had medium or high genetic risk combined with low or medium muscle strength but not for those who had medium genetic risk but high muscle strength. Associations were similar for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke (although CIs were inconclusive for some of the associations). Conclusion(s): Higher muscle strength was associated with lower stroke incidence in all individuals, including those with high genetic susceptibility.

Here we examine whether an integrated polygenic risk score improves the prediction of CAD beyond pooled cohort equations. METHODS: An observation study of 291,305 unrelated White British UK Biobank participants enrolled from 2006 to 2010 was conducted. A case-control sample of 9499 prevalent CAD cases and an equal number of randomly selected controls was used for tuning and integrating of the polygenic risk scores. A separate cohort of 272,307 individuals (with follow-up to 2020) was used to examine the risk prediction performance of pooled cohort equations, integrated polygenic risk score, and PRS-enhanced pooled cohort equation for incident CAD cases. The performance of each model was analyzed by discrimination and risk reclassification using a 7.5% threshold., RESULTS: In the cohort of 272,307 individuals (mean age, 56.7 years) used to analyze predictive accuracy, there were 7036 incident CAD cases over a 12-year follow-up period. Model discrimination was tested for integrated polygenic risk score, pooled cohort equation, and PRS-enhanced pooled cohort equation with reported C-statistics of 0.640 (95% CI, 0.634-0.646), 0.718 (95% CI, 0.713-0.723), and 0.753 (95% CI, 0.748-0.758), respectively. Risk reclassification for the addition of the integrated polygenic risk score to the pooled cohort equation at a 7.5% risk threshold resulted in a net reclassification improvement of 0.117 (95% CI, 0.102 to 0.129) for cases and - 0.023 (95% CI, - 0.025 to - 0.022) for noncases [overall: 0.093 (95% CI, 0.08 to 0.104)]. For incident CAD cases, this represented 14.2% correctly reclassified to the higher-risk category and 2.6% incorrectly reclassified to the lower-risk category., CONCLUSIONS: Addition of the integrated polygenic risk score for CAD to the pooled cohort questions improves the predictive accuracy for incident CAD and clinical risk classification in the White British from the UK Biobank. These findings suggest that an integrated polygenic risk score may enhance CAD risk prediction and screening in the White British population. Copyright © 2022.

In total, 10 previously identified risk loci explain a small fraction of AAA heritability. Method(s): We performed a genome-wide association study in the Million Veteran Program testing =18 million DNA sequence variants with AAA (7642 cases and 172 172 controls) in veterans of European ancestry with independent replication in up to 4972 cases and 99 858 controls. We then used mendelian randomization to examine the causal effects of blood pressure on AAA. We examined the association of AAA risk variants with aneurysms in the lower extremity, cerebral, and iliac arterial beds, and derived a genome-wide polygenic risk score (PRS) to identify a subset of the population at greater risk for disease. Result(s): Through a genome-wide association study, we identified 14 novel loci, bringing the total number of known significant AAA loci to 24. In our mendelian randomization analysis, we demonstrate that a genetic increase of 10 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure (odds ratio, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.24-1.66]; P=1.6x10-6), as opposed to systolic blood pressure (odds ratio, 1.06 [95% CI, 0.97-1.15]; P=0.2), likely has a causal relationship with AAA development. We observed that 19 of 24 AAA risk variants associate with aneurysms in at least 1 other vascular territory. A 29-variant PRS was strongly associated with AAA (odds ratioPRS, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.18-1.36]; PPRS=2.7x10-11 per SD increase in PRS), independent of family history and smoking risk factors (odds ratioPRS+family history+smoking, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.14-1.35]; PPRS=1.27x10-6). Using this PRS, we identified a subset of the population with AAA prevalence greater than that observed in screening trials informing current guidelines. Conclusion(s): We identify novel AAA genetic associations with therapeutic implications and identify a subset of the population at significantly increased genetic risk of AAA independent of family history. Our data suggest that extending current screening guidelines to include testing to identify those with high polygenic AAA risk, once the cost of genotyping becomes comparable with that of screening ultrasound, would significantly increase the yield of current screening at reasonable cost.

The aim of this study was to investigate the benefits of assessing hs-CRP among individuals with different cardiovascular risk factors., Methods: This nested case-control study was obtained from the Isfahan Cohort Study (ICS). Anyone who has been suffering from any CVDs, including myocardial infarction, unstable angina, sudden cardiac death and stroke was put in the case group. Density sampling method was utilized to choose the control group who had no aforementioned CVDs during follow-up. Four quartiles of hs-CRP (Q1: 0.1-2.3, Q2: 2.4-3, Q3: 3.1-4 and Q4: 4.1-14 mg/l) were assessed defining odds ratios (OR) of CVDs prediction in different CVDs risk factor categories. Confidence intervals of 95% are put in brackets., Results: A total of 502 cases and 538 controls were recruited. All hs-CRP quartiles showed increased CVDs likelihood compared to normal subjects in terms of diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN). Second quartile showed a 1.93 [1.33-2.81] and 3.34 [1.36-8.17] increased risks in patients with hypertriglyceridemia or dyslipidemia, respectively. Smokers in the third quartile group revealed increased CVDs risk. The fourth quartile showed significant increased risks in patients suffering from hypercholesterolemia (OR = 1.91 [1.33-2.74]), high LDL-C (OR = 1.88 [1.33-2.66]), and hypertriglyceridemia (OR = 2.31 [1.57-3.41])., Conclusions: Our findings suggested that assessing hs-CRP is beneficial for predicting CVDs in patients with HTN and DM. Furthermore, specific patients with lipid abnormalities or history of smoking benefits from checking hs-CRP.

We studied associations between the progression in combined measures of microvascular brain disease and risk of stroke in the ARIC study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities). Method(s): Prospective analysis of 907 stroke-free ARIC participants who underwent a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 1993 to 1995, a second brain MRI in 2004 to 2006, and were subsequently followed for stroke incidence through December 31, 2017 (median [25%-75%] follow-up 12.6 [8.9-13.4] years). A combined measure of microvascular brain disease was defined at each visit and categorized by progression from first to second brain MRI as no progression; mild progression (increase of >=1 unit in WMH grade or new lacune), and moderate progression (increase of >=1 unit in WMH grade and new lacune). All definite/probable ischemic or hemorrhagic incident strokes occurring after this second MRI, and through 2017, were included. Associations between microvascular brain disease, progression in the combined measures, and stroke incidence were studied with Cox proportional hazard models, adjusting for age, sex, race, education level, time from first to second MRI, body mass index, smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary heart disease. Result(s): At the second brain MRI (mean age 72), the distribution of the combined measure was 37% WMH grade <2 and no lacune; 57% WMH grade >=2 or lacune; and 6% WMH grade >=2 and lacune. No progression in the combined measures was observed in 38% of participants, 57% showed mild progression and 5% showed moderate progression. Sixty-four incident strokes occurred during the follow-up period. Compared with no change in the combined measure, moderate progression of microvascular brain disease was significantly associated with higher risk of stroke (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.00 [95% CI, 1.30-6.94]). Conclusion(s): Progression of microvascular brain disease, manifesting as both new lacunes and increase in WMHs grade, is related to substantial increase in long-Term risk of stroke.Copyright © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

We hypothesise that commercially available genetic assays may provide additional information on hereditary cardiovascular risk in a timely and cost-efficient manner. Method(s): In a cohort of 51 patients treated for coronary artery disease (CAD) at University Hospital Heidelberg, Germany, a subgroup of patients with \"unstable\" CAD (i.e. recurrent acute coronary syndrome) was identified and compared to patients with \"stable\" disease (i.e. chronic coronary syndrome). Gene array analysis using a commercial assay for 15 potentially pathogenic polymorphisms revealed our cohort's genetic risk profile regarding atherosclerotic/thromboembolic events. Improvement of cardiovascular risk assessment based on established risk scores was analysed using net reclassification, logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Result(s): Discriminatory capacity of traditional risk scores such as SCORE2 or PROCAM with regard to stable and unstable CAD groups was poor (ROC AUC <0.5). Patients with \"unstable\" CAD exhibited a significantly increased frequency of pathogenic eNOS 894 T and MTHFR 1298 C polymorphisms compared to \"stable\" CAD patients, and information on these polymorphisms individually as well as combinations with additional polymorphisms included in the assay such as ACE D/D or PAI-1 5 G variants markedly improved risk prediction compared to SCORE2/PROCAM alone (ROC AUC >=0.75).

Our findings suggest that there was a significant relationship between MTHFR gene A1298C gene polymorphism with risk of ischemic stroke (dominant model: OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.06-1.66, recessive model: OR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.06-1.99 and allelic model: OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.00-1.84, respectively). However, no significant relationship between MTHFR gene A1298C gene polymorphism with the risk of hemorrhagic stroke. Findings of this meta-analysis concludes that MTHFR gene A1298 C polymorphism could be capable of increasing stroke susceptibility in Asian, but not in Caucasian population. Genotyping of MTHFR gene A1298C polymorphism may be used as a predictor for the occurrence of ischemic stroke.Copyright © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Authors":"Kumar, A.; Sharma, R.; Misra, S.; Nath, M.; Kumar, P.","Publisher":"Neurological Research","Issue":"11","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01616412.2020.1798107","Pages":"913-922","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene A1298 C polymorphism"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":3,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":43,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":47,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":58,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":1875,"Title":"A susceptibility putative haplotype within NLRP3 inflammasome gene influences ischaemic stroke risk in the population of Punjab, India","Year":2022,"Country":"","Abstract":"Despite strong genetic implications of NLRP3 inflammasome, its examination as genetic determinant of ischaemic stroke (IS) remains to be done in Punjab, which has been investigated in this study. In this case control study, 400 subjects (200 IS patients, 200 stroke free controls) were included. Contributions of 5 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) including a functional SNP within NLRP3 gene (rs10754558, rs4612666, rs2027432, rs3738488 and rs1539019) for the risk of IS were investigated through genetic models after correcting the effect of significant variables. Plasma levels of three pro-inflammatory markers, that is, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Minor alleles of 3 out of 5 SNPs (rs10754558, rs4612666 and rs1539019) exhibited association with IS risk in additive, recessive and multiplicative models. Multivariable regression analysis confirmed that higher levels of systolic blood pressure (beta +/- SE: 1.42 +/- 0.57, p =.013), CRP (beta +/- SE: 1.22 +/- 0.41, p =.003), IL-1beta (beta +/- SE: 1.78 +/- 0.88, p =.043) and IL-18 (beta +/- SE: 1.13 +/- 0.49, p =.021) were independent risk predictors for IS.

The present case-control study hypothesized that genetic polymorphisms in tumor necrosis factor- alpha (TNF-alpha) gene may affect the risk of ICH. Material(s) and Method(s): In this study, we investigated the association of four single nucleotide polymorphisms (-308G/A, +488G/A, -857C/T, and -1031T/C) within TNF-alpha gene promoter and their haplotypes with the risk of ICH in a North Indian population. Genotyping was determined by using the SNaPshot method for 100 ICH patients and 100 age and sex-matched ICH-free controls. Conditional logistic regression analysis with adjusting multiple demographic and risk factor variables was used to calculate the strength of association between TNF-alpha gene polymorphisms and risk of ICH. Haplotypes were reconstructed using PHASE 2.0, and patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis were performed using Haploview version 4.2 software. Result(s): TNF-alpha +488G/A gene polymorphism was found to be independently associated with the risk of ICH under dominant [GG + GA vs. AA] (OR = 3.1; 95% CI = 1.2-8.2; P = 0.001) and allelic [G vs. A] (OR = 2.2; 95% CI = 1.2-4.2; P = 0.007) models. However, no significant association between -308G/A, -857C/T, and -1031T/C gene polymorphisms and risk of ICH was observed. Haplotype analysis showed that 308A-488G-857C-1031T and 308G-488A-857T-1031T haplotypes were significantly associated with an increased risk of ICH. Strong LD was observed for + 488G/A and -857C/T TNF-alpha polymorphisms (D' = 0.72, r2= 0.01). Conclusion(s): Our findings suggest that the TNF-alpha +488G/A polymorphism may be an important risk factor for ICH, whereas -308G/A, -857C/T, and -1031T/C gene polymorphisms may not be associated with risk of ICH in North Indian population.Copyright © 2020 Neurology India, Neurological Society of India.","Authors":"Kumar, P.; Misra, S.; Kumar, A.; Faruq, M.; Vivekanandhan, S.; Srivastava, A.

We aimed to create a model to predict MVD using a combination of quantitative MPI values and background factors of patients. We also assessed whether patients in the same database could be selected who do not require rest studies (stress-only imaging)., METHODS: We analyzed data from 1001 patients who had been assessed by stress MPI at 12 centers and 463 patients who had not undergone revascularization in Japan. Quantitative values based on MPI were obtained using cardioREPO software, which included myocardial perfusion defect scores, left ventricular ejection fractions and volumes. Factors in MPI and clinical backgrounds that could predict MVD were investigated using univariate and multivariate analyses. We also investigated whether stress data alone could predict patients without coronary stenosis to identify candidates for stress-only imaging., RESULTS: We selected summed stress score (SSS), rest end-diastolic volume, and hypertension to create a predictive model for MVD. A logistic regression model was created with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.825. To more specifically predict coronary three-vessel disease, the AUC was 0.847 when SSS, diabetes, and hypertension were selected. The mean probabilities of abnormality based on the MVD prediction model were 12%, 24%, 40%, and 51% for no-, one-, two-, and three-vessel disease, respectively (p < 0.0001). For the model to select patients with stress-only imaging, the AUC was 0.78 when the model was created using SSS, stress end-systolic volume and the number of risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and a history of smoking)., CONCLUSION: A model analysis combining myocardial SPECT and clinical data can predict MVD, and can select patients for stress-only tests. Our models should prove useful for clinical applications. Copyright © 2022.

To clarify whether cortisol causes these outcomes, we assessed the role of cortisol in ischemic heart disease (IHD), ischemic stroke, T2DM, and CVD risk factors using a bi-directional Mendelian randomization (MR) study. Method(s): Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) strongly (P < 5 x 10-6) and independently (r2 < 0.001) predicting cortisol were obtained from the CORtisol NETwork (CORNET) consortium (n = 12,597) and two metabolomics genome-wide association studies (GWAS) (n = 7824 and n = 2049). They were applied to GWAS of the primary outcomes (IHD, ischemic stroke and T2DM) and secondary outcomes (adiposity, glycemic traits, blood pressure and lipids) to obtain estimates using inverse variance weighting, with weighted median, MR-Egger, and MR-PRESSO as sensitivity analyses. Conversely, SNPs predicting IHD, ischemic stroke, and T2DM were applied to the cortisol GWAS. Result(s): Genetically predicted cortisol (based on 6 SNPs from CORNET; F-statistic = 28.3) was not associated with IHD (odds ratio (OR) 0.98 per 1 unit increase in log-transformed cortisol, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93-1.03), ischemic stroke (0.99, 95% CI 0.91-1.08), T2DM (1.00, 95% CI 0.96-1.04), or CVD risk factors. Genetically predicted IHD, ischemic stroke, and T2DM were not associated with cortisol. Conclusion(s): Contrary to observational studies, genetically predicted cortisol was unrelated to IHD, ischemic stroke, T2DM, or CVD risk factors, or vice versa.

We hypothesized the MPI could prove valuable for assessing cardiac risk in subjects of the general population with decreased estimated GFR (eGFR). MPI was measured in 1915 subjects from a large general population prospective cohort study using color tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) M-mode through the mitral valve. We compared the prognostic capabilities of the MPI between subjects with eGFR >= 75 mL/min/1.73 m2 and subjects with eGFR < 75 mL/min/1.73 m2 using multivariable adjusted Cox regression models. The composite endpoint was heart failure, myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death. Mean age was 58 years (SD 16.2), 58% were women, 42% had hypertension and 8.3% diabetes. During a median follow-up time of 12.4 years [IQR 10.6-12.7 years] 269 participants reached the combined endpoint. eGFR modified the prognostic capability of MPI (p-value for interaction < 0.001): After multivariable adjustment, MPI remained an independent predictor of the composite endpoint only in participants with eGFR < 75 mL/min/1.73 m2: HR 1.18 (95% CI 1.02-1.38), p = 0.03, vs. in subjects with eGFR >= 75 mL/min/1.73 m2: HR 1.14 (95% CI 0.94-1.39), p = 0.17.

Method(s): We included 10,510 individuals with methylation extent measurements and information on smoking status from the Copenhagen City Heart Study (CCHS), a prospective, cohort study of the general population carried out from 1991 to 2003. The endpoint myocardial infarction was retrieved from the national Danish Patient Registry and the national Danish Causes of Death Registry.

Method(s): Three genetic variants in the SERPINA1/SERPINA6 locus and functionally associated with plasma cortisol were identified in the CORtisol NETwork consortium (12 597 participants). Summary-level genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for the associations between the cortisol-associated variants and AF were obtained from a GWAS meta-analysis of 6 studies (60 620 AF cases and 970 216 noncases) and the FinnGen consortium (17 325 AF cases and 97 214 noncases). The fixed-effects inverse-variance weighted approach accounting for genetic correlations between variants was used for analysis. Multivariable MR analyses were conducted to assess potential mediating effects of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and waist circumference (WC). Summary-level GWAS data for SBP and WC were obtained respectively from the International Consortium of Blood Pressure (757 601 participants) and the Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits consortium (232 101 participants).

We employed Mendelian randomisation to explore the associations between genetically predicted serum IGF-1 levels and cardiometabolic diseases., METHODS: Serum IGF-1 levels were predicted using 416 SNPs associated with IGF-1 levels among 358,072 individuals in UK Biobank. Genetic association estimates for the outcomes were obtained from consortia of type 2 diabetes (74,124 cases, 824,006 controls), coronary artery disease (60,801 cases, 123,504 controls), heart failure (47,309 cases, 930,014 controls), atrial fibrillation (65,446 cases, 522,744 controls), and ischaemic stroke (60,341 cases, 454,450 controls)., RESULTS: Genetic predisposition to elevated serum IGF-1 levels was associated with higher risk of type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease. The OR (95% CI) per SD increment in IGF-1 level was 1.14 (1.05, 1.24) for type 2 diabetes and 1.09 (1.02, 1.16) for coronary artery disease. The association between IGF-1 and coronary artery disease was attenuated after adjustment for type 2 diabetes (OR 1.06 [95% CI 1.00, 1.13]), suggesting that the association may be partly mediated via type 2 diabetes. There was limited evidence of associations between IGF-1 levels and heart failure, atrial fibrillation and ischaemic stroke., CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This study found evidence that increased IGF-1 levels may be causally associated with higher risk of type 2 diabetes.

The use of coronary artery calcium (CAC) to predict risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in asymptomatic patients is accepted. However, little is known regarding the use of CAC in PET/CT patients without known CAD in identifying patients unlikely to need revascularization. Here, we determined whether the absence of CAC, using low-dose attenuation correction CT obtained during the PET/CT, identifies patients unlikely to undergo coronary revascularization within 90 days of a PET/CT. METHOD(S): Patients, without a history of CAD and no elevation in troponin, referred for PET/CT at Intermountain Medical Center were studied (n=5528). The presence of CAC was visually assessed using low-dose attenuation correction CT. The association between CAC and 90-day high-grade CAD and revascularization were assessed. Longer-term (up to 4 years) major adverse cardiovascular events, including all-cause death, myocardial infarction, and late revascularization (>90 days), were examined. RESULT(S): There were 2510 (45.4%) patients in CAC-present group and 3018 (54.6%) patients in CAC-absent group. The CAC-absent group, compared with the CAC-present group, was less likely to undergo coronary angiography (3.4% versus 10.2%, P<0.0001), have high-grade CAD (0.5% versus 6.5%, P<0.0001), and receive revascularization (0.4% versus 5.8%, [adjusted odds ratio =0.09; 95% CI, 0.05-0.16]; P<0.0001). In patients with an ischemic burden >10%, the CAC-absent group was associated with reduced revascularization (P<0.0001). Longer-term major adverse cardiovascular events were lower in the CAC-absent (2.4%) compared with the CAC-present (6.9%) group (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.45 [95% CI, 0.34-0.60]; P<0.0001). CONCLUSION(S): The absence of CAC on low-dose attenuation correction CT identifies PET/CT patients unlikely to have high-grade CAD or require revascularization within 90 days and unlikely to experience longer-term major adverse cardiovascular events. The prognostic value of CAC, beyond ischemic burden, suggests its potential as a first-step screening tool in intermediate-risk patients to identify those who do not need coronary revascularization.Copyright © 2020 American Heart Association, Inc.","Authors":"Le, V.

Individual-level MR confirmed that each 1-SD increase in height increased the odds of atrial fibrillation, including adjustment for clinical and echocardiographic confounders (OR 1.89; 95% CI 1.50 to 2.40; p = 0.007). The main limitations of this study include potential bias from pleiotropic effects of genetic variants, and lack of generalizability of individual-level findings to non-European populations. Conclusions In this study, we observed evidence that height is likely a positive causal risk factor for atrial fibrillation. Further study is needed to determine whether risk prediction tools including height or anthropometric risk factors can be used to improve screening and primary prevention of atrial fibrillation, and whether biological pathways involved in height may offer new targets for treatment of atrial fibrillation.Copyright: © 2020 Levin et al.","Authors":"Levin, M.

Objective(s): To determine the association between genetic liability to smoking and risk of CAD, PAD, and large-artery stroke. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): Mendelian randomization study using summary statistics from genome-wide associations of smoking (UK Biobank; up to 462690 individuals), CAD (Coronary Artery Disease Genome Wide Replication and Meta-analysis plus the Coronary Artery Disease Genetics Consortium; up to 60801 cases, 123504 controls), PAD (VA Million Veteran Program; up to 24009 cases, 150983 controls), and large-artery stroke (MEGASTROKE; up to 4373 cases, 406111 controls). This study was conducted using summary statistic data from large, previously described cohorts. Review of those publications does not reveal the total recruitment dates for those cohorts. Data analyses were conducted from August 2019 to June 2020. Exposures: Genetic liability to smoking (as proxied by genetic variants associated with lifetime smoking index). Main Outcomes and Measures: Risk (odds ratios [ORs]) of CAD, PAD, and large-artery stroke. Result(s): Genetic liability to smoking was associated with increased risk of PAD (OR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.78-2.56; P = 3.6 x 10-16), CAD (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.25-1.75; P = 4.4 x 10-6), and stroke (OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.02-1.92; P =.04). Genetic liability to smoking was associated with greater risk of PAD than risk of large-artery stroke (ratio of ORs, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.05-2.19; P =.02) or CAD (ratio of ORs, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.12-1.84; P =.004). The association between genetic liability to smoking and atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases remained independent from the effects of smoking on traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Conclusions and Relevance: In this mendelian randomization analysis of data from large studies of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, genetic liability to smoking was a strong risk factor for CAD, PAD, and stroke, although the estimated association was strongest between smoking and PAD.

In order to improve our understanding of the risk factors associated with IS, we investigated the combined effect of the methylation of five genes related to the metabolism of homocysteine on developing IS., METHODS: Quantitative methylation-specific PCR was used to measure the levels of promoter methylation in hypertensive and stroke patients. The cutoff value calculated by the maximum Youden index was used to classify the levels of gene methylation as hypomethylation and hypermethylation. Logistic regression was used to explore the relationship between gene methylation and IS., RESULTS: The methylation levels of the genes encoding methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1 [MTHFD1], cystathionine beta-synthase [CBS], and dihydrofolate reductase [DHFR] in hypertensive patients were higher than those in stroke patients (all p < 0.01). MTHFD1 hypermethylation, CBS hypermethylation, and DHFR hypermethylation were protective factors for stroke after adjustment for confounding factors. Compared with individuals carrying none of the biomarkers, the ORs [95% CIs] for stroke of those with 1 and 2 elevated biomarkers were 4.068 [1.670-9.913] and 15.345 [6.198-37.994] after adjustment for confounding factors.

The aim of this study was to explore the effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of interleukin-35 (IL-35) genes and its relationship with environment on the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD)., METHODS: We performed Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test on the control group. The relationship between the four SNPs of IL-35 genes and the risk of coronary heart disease was studied by multivariate logistic regression. The best interaction was identified with generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR). Logistic regression was used for investigation on association between four SNPs and CHD risk., RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis showed that the C allele of rs428253 and the G allele of rs2243115 were independently correlated with increased risk of CHD, and adjusted ORs (95% CI) were 1.91 (1.28-2.64) and 1.80 (1.30-2.23), respectively. However, there was no significant association between CHD and rs4740 or rs568408. GMDR model indicated a best model for CHD risk consisted of rs428253 and current smoking, which scored 10/10 for both the sign test and cross-validation consistency (p = 0.010).

Methods and Results: Our primary study cohort included 1859 participants from the Spanish PREDIMED trial, and validation cohorts included 6868 participants from the US Nurses' Health Studies I and II, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (NHS/HPFS). Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was assessed using a validated Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS), and plasma metabolome was profiled by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. We observed substantial metabolomic variation with respect to Mediterranean diet adherence, with nearly one-third of the assayed metabolites significantly associated with MEDAS (false discovery rate < 0.05). Using elastic net regularized regressions, we identified a metabolic signature, comprised of 67 metabolites, robustly correlated with Mediterranean diet adherence in both PREDIMED and NHS/HPFS (r = 0.28-0.37 between the signature and MEDAS; P = 3 x 10-35 to 4 x 10-118). In multivariable Cox regressions, the metabolic signature showed a significant inverse association with CVD incidence after adjusting for known risk factors (PREDIMED: Hazard ratio [HR] per standard deviation increment in the signature = 0.71, P < 0.001; NHS/HPFS: HR = 0.85, P = 0.001), and the association persisted after further adjustment for MEDAS scores (PREDIMED: HR = 0.73, P = 0.004; NHS/HPFS: HR = 0.85, P = 0.004). Further genome-wide association analysis revealed that the metabolic signature was significantly associated with genetic loci involved in fatty acids and amino acids metabolism. Mendelian randomization analyses showed that the genetically inferred metabolic signature was significantly associated with risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke (odds ratios per SD increment in the genetically inferred metabolic signature = 0.92 for CHD and 0.91 for stroke; P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): We identified a metabolic signature that robustly reflects adherence and metabolic response to a Mediterranean diet, and predicts future CVD risk independent of traditional risk factors, in Spanish and US cohorts.Copyright © 2020 Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

Objective(s): This study aimed to examine the association between SNP rs1764391 of Cx37 and disease-susceptibility, several risk factors, and gene-environment interactions of AMI in Guangxi Han Chinese population. Method(s): In this study, 344 healthy controls and 344 AMI patients of Han Chinese population were enrolled. The TaqMan assay was implemented to identify genotypes of Cx37 and allele frequencies of SNP rs1764391 in both the AMI and control groups. Result(s): Significant differences were detected in TT genotype frequencies of SNP rs1764391 between the AMI and control groups (P < 0.05). In the context of gender stratification, the result was also statistically different in women (P < 0.05). Each variable such as age, BMI, diabetes, high blood pressure, smoking and TC was a risk factor and correlated significantly (P < 0.05) with the development of AMI. HDL-C correlated negatively with the risk of AMI (P < 0.001). BMI, smoking or alcohol consumed interacts significantly (P < 0.017) with the presence of the SNP rs1764391 CC genotype. Conclusion(s): Evidences were presented that Cx37 rs1764391 variation may contribute to the risk for AMI, especially in women and this genetic variant may prove to be a potential biomarker for AMI risk stratification and may prove to be a useful target for therapeutic intervention to further improve prognosis in high-risk patients.Copyright © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.","Authors":"Li, J.; Qin, R.; Wang, W.; Huang, Z.; Huang, D.

This study was conducted on an expanded number of samples to evaluate The usefulness of ZCCHC9 gene expression in peripheral blood as a molecular marker for the prediction of AMI (acute myocardial infarction) risk. Patients and Methods: Peripheral blood samples were collected from 117 patients with stable CAD (coronary atherosclerotic disease) and 126 patients with AMI. The mRNA level of the ZCCHC9 gene was assessed by qRT-PCR, and its protein level was determined by Western blotting. Result(s): The AMI group exhibited reduced expression of the ZCCHC9 gene, at both transcript and protein levels, than the stable CAD group. The low expression of the ZCCHC9 gene was not related to blood glucose level (P=0.635), blood lipid level, and troponin level (P=0.715), and may cause AMI through the MAPK signaling pathway. Compared with other patients, patients with low ZCCHC9 gene expression in their peripheral blood have a 2.597-fold higher risk of AMI. Conclusion(s): ZCCHC9 gene expression in peripheral blood was significantly lower in patients with AMI than in stable CAD patients. Individuals with low expression of ZCCHC9 in peripheral blood have higher a probability to develop AMI than those with stable CAD. Thus, lowered ZCCHC9 gene expression can act as an independent risk factor for AMI.Copyright © 2022 Li et al.","Authors":"Li, L.; Meng, H.; Wang, X.; Ruan, J.; Tian, X.; Meng, F.","Publisher":"International Journal of General Medicine","Issue":"Not Available","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.2147/IJGM.S346335","Pages":"1795-1804","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"zinc finger protein ZCCHC9"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":28,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":43,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":47,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":49,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":54,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":56,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":2038,"Title":"Genetically determined intelligence and coronary artery disease risk","Year":2021,"Country":"","Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies have shown inverse association between intelligence and coronary artery disease (CAD) risk, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear., METHODS: Based on 242 SNPs independently associated with intelligence, we calculated the genetic intelligence score (gIQ) for participants from 10 CAD case-control studies (n = 34,083) and UK Biobank (n = 427,306).

Methods and Results: Individual-level data from the Kailuan cohort recruited between 2006 and 2017 were included. Serum CRP levels were measured at baseline and at biennial follow-up visits, and incident AF was ascertained from biennial 12-lead ECG assessment and medical records. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association between baseline CRP levels or cumulative exposure to CRP and incident AF. A meta-analysis including nine prospective cohort studies and our current study was also conducted. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed to evaluate the aetiological role of CRP in AF. In our observational study (n = 86,424), high baseline CRP levels (>3 mg/L), compared with low CRP (<1 mg/L), were not significantly associated with AF risk (HR: 1.18; 95% CI: 0.99-1.40). High cumulative exposure to CRP (HR: 1.49; 95%CI: 1.01-2.21) was significantly associated with an increased risk of AF. Our meta-analysis suggested a positive association between elevated CRP levels and incident AF (relative risk: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.14-1.42). However, no significant association between genetically determined CRP and AF risk was observed in the MR analysis. Conclusion(s): Evidence from observational studies suggested that elevated serum CRP levels were positively associated with incident AF, while the causal effects of CRP on AF were not supported by the MR analysis.

However, the systematic assessment of IS risk still needs the accumulation of molecular phenotype and function from the level of omics. In this study, we integrated IS phenome, polygenic interaction gene expression and molecular function to screen the risk gene and molecular function. Then, we performed a case-control study including 507 cases and 503 controls to verify the genetic associated relationship among the candidate functional genes and the IS phenotype in a northern Chinese Han population. Mediation analysis revealed that the blood pressure, high density lipoprotein (HDL) and glucose mediated the potential effect of SOCS1, CD137, ALOX5AP, RNLS, and KALRN in IS, both for the functional analysis and genetic association. And the SNP-SNP interactions analysis by multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) approach also presented a combination effect of IS risk. The further interaction network and gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis suggested that CD137 and KALRN functioning in inflammatory could play an expanded role during the pathogenesis and progression of IS. The present study opens a new avenue to evaluate the underlying mechanisms and biomarkers of IS through integrating multiple omics information.© Copyright © 2020 Li, Shi, Zhang, Zhang, Hou, Wu, Lu, Feng, Tian and Sun.","Authors":"Li, X.; Shi, W.; Zhang, R.; Zhang, S.; Hou, W.; Wu, Y.; Lu, R.; Feng, Y.; Tian, J.; Sun, L.","Publisher":"Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology","Issue":"Not Available","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2020.00453","Pages":"453","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"14 variants in RNLS & ALOX5AP & CD137 & KALRN & SOCS1"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":25,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":42,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":47,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":49,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":50,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":51,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":52,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":55,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":56,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":2066,"Title":"Healthy Sleep Patterns and Risk of Incident Arrhythmias","Year":2021,"Country":"","Abstract":"Background: Emerging evidence has linked sleep behaviors with the risk of cardiac arrhythmias. The various sleep behaviors are typically correlated; however, most of the previous studies only focused on the individual sleep behavior, without considering the overall sleep patterns. Objective(s): The purpose of this study was to prospectively investigate the associations between a healthy sleep pattern with the risks of cardiac arrhythmias. Method(s): A total of 403,187 participants from UK Biobank were included. A healthy sleep pattern was defined by chronotype, sleep duration, insomnia, snoring, and daytime sleepiness. Weighted genetic risk score for atrial fibrillation was calculated. Result(s): The healthy sleep pattern was significantly associated with lower risks of atrial fibrillation/flutter (AF) (HR comparing extreme categories: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.64-0.80) and bradyarrhythmia (HR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.54-0.77), but not ventricular arrhythmias, after adjustment for demographic, lifestyle, and genetic risk factors. Compared with individuals with a healthy sleep score of 0-1 (poor sleep group), those with a healthy sleep score of 5 had a 29% and 35% lower risk of developing AF and bradyarrhythmia, respectively. Additionally, the genetic predisposition to AF significantly modified the association of the healthy sleep pattern with the risk of AF (P interaction = 0.017). The inverse association of the healthy sleep pattern with the risk of AF was stronger among those with a lower genetic risk of AF. Conclusion(s): Our results indicate that a healthy sleep pattern is associated with lower risks of AF and bradyarrhythmia, independent of traditional risk factors, and the association with AF is modified by genetic susceptibility.Copyright © 2021 American College of Cardiology Foundation","Authors":"Li, X.; Zhou, T.; Ma, H.; Huang, T.; Gao, X.; Manson, J.

In this study, we therefore sought to investigate how miR-155 and AT1R polymorphisms affect IS risk. We included 579 IS patients and 509 age-matched controls in the present analysis, genotyping individuals for the rs767649 polymorphism in miR-155, as well as for the rs1492099 and rs275653 polymorphisms in AT1R via iMLDR-TM genotyping technology. The allele and genotype frequencies for the assessed polymorphisms were comparable in IS patients and controls, without any detectable association between AT1R haplotype and IS risk. We conducted additional trial of ORG 10172 in acute stroke treatment-mediated stratification, which indicated that the AT1R rs1492099 T allele was linked to a decreased risk of large-artery atherosclerosis (LAA) stroke. We further found that those with the AT1R rs275653 AA genotype had a decreased risk of small-artery occlusion (SAO) strokes. We further confirmed elevated miR-155 expression in IS patients, but observed no link between the rs767649 polymorphism and expression of this microRNA. Similarly, rs1492099 and rs275653 polymorphisms did not impact AT1R expression levels. The miR-155 rs767649 polymorphism does not seem to be a key determinant of IS risk, whereas the AT1R rs1492099 polymorphism is linked to reduced LAA-stroke risk, and the rs275653 AA genotype is potentially protective against SAO strokes.© Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.","Authors":"Li, Y.; Peng, Y.; Yao, S.; Chen, L.; Li, S.; Wang, M.; Chen, S.; Chen, X.; Deng, F.; Hu, W.; Zhu, P.; Zhao, B.; Zhong, W.; Ma, G.","Publisher":"DNA and Cell Biology","Issue":"1","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/dna.2019.4948","Pages":"92-104","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"miR-155 rs767649 & AT1R rs1492099 & rs275653 polymorphisms"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":6,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":43,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":47,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":58,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":2075,"Title":"Exome risk score for predicting susceptibility to and severity of isolated thoracic aortic aneurysm","Year":2022,"Country":"","Abstract":"Isolated thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) are asymptomatic before dissection or rupture and heterogeneous in clinical phenotype. It is urgent need but difficult to identify individuals at high risk to enable enhanced screening or preventive therapies. Because TAAs have a genetic component, one possible approach is to stratify individuals based on inherited DNA variations. Here, we constructed an integrated exome risk score (ERS) based on both common and rare variants found in whole-exome sequencing through a machine-learning framework in discovery population consisting of 551 cases and 1071 controls. We evaluated the performance of the ERS in an independent population including 151 cases and 779 controls with a raw odds ratio (OR) per 1 standard deviation (SD) = 1.95 and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.680. When adjusted by gender and the first four principal components, OR per SD = 1.68 and AUC reached 0.783. Individuals in the top 20% of ERS distribution had an OR of 3.20 compared with others. Finally, we found that individuals with top 20% ERS developed TAA at a younger age (P = 0.002) and with a larger diameter (P = 0.016) compared with lower ERS, and were more likely to suffer from aortic root aneurysms (P = 0.009). Our analysis provides a global view of the genetic components of isolated TAA. The exome score developed and evaluated here is the first polygenic risk score for TAA and is a promising predictor of disease risk and severity, which will facilitate the implementation of the risk-reduction strategies.

However, little is known about their roles in coronary artery disease (CAD). The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationships between circulating exosomal lncRNAs and CAD and identify the aberrantly expressed disease-related lncRNAs as biomarkers in diagnosing CAD., METHODS: The aberrantly expressed lncRNAs in plasma exosomes from CAD patients and controls were identified by microarray analysis and verified by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Then, the correlation between the expression level of candidate biomarker and clinic features in CAD patients, mild coronary artery stenosis (mCAS) patients, and controls was analyzed. Finally, we used the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to examine the diagnosis value of candidate biomarkers., RESULTS: The downregulated SOCS2-AS1 was determined by microarray analysis and verified by qRT-PCR in plasma from CAD patients in contrast to controls. The SOCS2-AS1 expression level in plasma exosomes was negatively correlated with PLT and Lpa. Moreover, CAD patients with elevated levels of plasma exosome-encapsulated SOCS2-AS1 were susceptible to multicoronary artery lesions.

This study evaluated the associations of genetically predicted FGF23 with major CVDs, their risk factors, kidney function, and longevity using Mendelian randomization (MR). Method(s): This is a two-sample MR study using summary statistics from large genome-wide association studies. Primary outcomes included coronary artery disease (CAD), myocardial infarction, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular risk factors, kidney function, and longevity. We used four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) predicting FGF23, excluding rs2769071 in the ABO gene, which likely violates the MR exclusion-restriction assumption. We used inverse-variance weighted (IVW) as the primary statistical method to assess associations of FGF23 with the outcomes. Sensitivity analyses included weighted median (WM) and MR-Egger. We repeated the analyses including all five SNPs. Last, we validated the positive findings from the main analyses in a smaller study, i.e., FinnGen. Result(s): Using IVW, genetically predicted higher FGF23 was inversely associated with risk of CAD [odds ratio (OR): 0.69 per logtransformed FGF23 (pg/ml) increase, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.52-0.91] and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (OR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.52-0.96), but not with the other outcomes. The WM and MR-Egger estimates were directionally consistent. Conclusion(s): This study suggests that genetically predicted higher FGF23 may be protective against CAD and T2DM. Future studies should explore the underlying mechanisms related to the potential protective effect of FGF23. FGF23 was unlikely a cause of poorer renal function.© Copyright © 2021 Liang, Luo, Schooling and Au Yeung.","Authors":"Liang, Y.; Luo, S.; Schooling, C. M.; Au Yeung, S.

Moreover, plaques with higher calcium burden were found in the left anterior descending artery (mean CACS: 386.15+/-203.89), followed by right coronary (239.77+/-219.83) and left circumflex (175.56+/-153.54) arteries., CONCLUSION: The results indicate a strong positive association of CACS with coronary artery stenosis. CACS was also significantly associated with conventional CAD risk factors in this population. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

The performance of these scores is not well known in patients with moderate to advanced chronic kidney disease, particularly in combination with clinically available cardiac biomarkers including N-terminal pro- brain-type natriuretic peptide and high-sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT). METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 1027 participants from the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort without self-reported atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease who were not taking aspirin or statins at enrollment. Framingham Risk Score, Pooled Cohort Equation, N-terminal pro- brain-type natriuretic peptide, and hsTnT were measured at baseline. Outcomes included fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiac death. We calculated 10-fold cross-validated Harrell's C-indices for each risk score and cardiac biomarker alone and in combination. The C-index (95% CI) for discrimination of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease was 0.72 (0.67, 0.77) for the Framingham Risk Score, and 0.72 (0.67, 0.76) for the Pooled Cohort Equation. HsTnT had comparable discrimination to each risk score, and improved the discrimination of each (change in Framingham 0.029, 95% CI 0.003, 0.055; change in Pooled Cohort Equation 0.027, 95% CI 0.002, 0.052). N-terminal pro- brain-type natriuretic peptide had poorer discrimination than the risk scores and did not significantly improve their discrimination (change in Framingham 0.009, 95% CI -0.001, 0.018; change in Pooled Cohort Equation 0.011, 95% CI -0.001, 0.024). CONCLUSION(S): The Framingham Risk Score and Pooled Cohort Equation demonstrated moderate discrimination for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in patients with chronic kidney disease. HsTnT, but not N-terminal pro- brain-type natriuretic peptide, improved their discrimination overall. Until chronic kidney disease- specific atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk scores can be developed, it may be worth considering how to incorporate hsTnT into existing clinical risk scores.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.","Authors":"Lidgard, B.; Zelnick, L.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate conventional risk factors, as well as plasma and erythrocyte aminothiol concentration in high-risk Azorean patients undergoing elective coronary angiography and to investigate whether any aminothiol was associated with CAD risk and severity., METHODS AND RESULTS: 174 subjects with symptomatic CAD (age 56+/-9y; 68% men) submitted to coronary angiography were split into 2 groups: one formed by CAD patients (>=50% stenosis in at least one major coronary vessel) and the other by non-CAD patients (<50% stenosis). Both groups were age-, sex- and BMI-matched. Plasma and erythrocyte aminothiol profiles were evaluated by RP-HPLC/FLD. CAD patients significantly exhibited both higher concentrations of plasma Cys and hypercysteinemia (Cys >= 300 muM) prevalence than those in the non-CAD group (261 +/- 58 muM vs. 243 +/- 56 muM; 22% vs. 10%, respectively). No differences were observed between groups regarding plasma Hcy levels or hyperhomocysteinemia prevalence. After adjustment for several confounders (including Hcy), subjects in the highest quartile of plasma Cys had a 3.31 (95% CI, 1.32-8.30, p = 0.011) fold risk for CAD, compared with those in the lowest quartiles. Furthermore, plasma Cys levels (but not Hcy) tended to increase with the number of stenotic vessels (1VD: 253 +/- 64 muM; 2VD: 262 +/- 52 muM; 3VD: 279 +/- 57 muM, p = 0.129)., CONCLUSION: Hypercysteinemia revealed to be a better predictor of CAD than hyperhomocysteinemia. Moreover, plasma Cys showed to be a useful biomarker for CAD both in primary and secondary preventions, seeming to resist better than Hcy to oral medication therapy.

We evaluated the association of stroke with genetic polymorphisms in the alcohol metabolizing genes, alcohol dehydrogenase 1B (ADH1B, rs1229984) and aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2, rs671) genes based on alcohol consumption. Method(s): Data were available for 19,500 Taiwan Biobank (TWB) participants. We used logistic regression models to test for associations between genetic variants and stroke. Overall, there were 890 individuals with ischemic stroke, 70 with hemorrhagic stroke, and 16,837 control individuals. Participants with ischemic but not hemorrhagic stroke were older than their control individuals (mean +/- SE, 58.47 +/- 8.17 vs. 48.33 +/- 10.90 years, p < 0.0001). ALDH2 rs671 was not associated with either hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke among alcohol drinkers. However, the risk of developing hemorrhagic stroke was significantly higher among ADH1B rs1229984 TC + CC individuals who drank alcohol (odds ratio (OR), 4.85; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.92-12.21). We found that the test for interaction was significant for alcohol exposure and rs1229984 genotypes (p for interaction = 0.016). Stratification by alcohol exposure and ADH1B rs1229984 genotypes showed that the risk of developing hemorrhagic stroke remained significantly higher among alcohol drinkers with TC + CC genotype relative to those with the TT genotype (OR, 4.43, 95% CI 1.19-16.52). Conclusion(s): Our study suggests that the ADH1B rs1229984 TC + CC genotype and alcohol exposure of at least 150 ml/week may increase the risk of developing hemorrhagic stroke among Taiwanese adults.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).","Authors":"Lin, C.

The yield of serial electrocardiographic (ECG) screening for AF is unknown. Objective(s): The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of AF detected by serial, 7-day ECG patch screenings in older women identified as having an elevated risk of AF according to the CHARGE (Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology)-AF clinical prediction score. Method(s): Postmenopausal women with a 5-year predicted risk of new-onset AF >=5% according to CHARGE-AF were recruited from the ongoing WHISH (Women's Health Initiative Strong and Healthy) randomized trial of a physical activity intervention. Participants with AF at baseline by self-report or medical records review were excluded. Screening with 7-day ECG patch monitors was performed at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months from study enrollment. Result(s): On baseline monitoring, 2.5% of the cohort had AF detected, increasing to 3.7% by 6 months and 4.9% cumulatively by 12 months. Yield of patch screening was higher among participants with a higher (>=10%) CHARGE-AF score: 4.2% had AF detected at baseline, 5.9% at 6 months, and 7.2% at 12 months.

In this retrospective cohort study, patients who underwent Tc-99m ECD brain SPECT from January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2008 were included. Each study was reoriented with the Talairach space provided by the NeuroGam Software package. Heterogeneity of brain perfusion was measured as the coefficient of variation. The study outcome was the risk of cerebral vascular accidents in patients with increased heterogeneity of brain perfusion between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2015. A multiple Cox proportional hazards model was applied to evaluate the risk of cerebrovascular accidents. A total of 70 patients were included in this study. The median age was 39 years (range, 28 - 59 years). There were 55 (78.6%) women.

Accurate prediction of the risk of PCAD is very important for the prevention and early diagnosis of this disease. Machine learning (ML) has been proven a reliable method used for disease diagnosis and for building risk prediction models based on complex factors. The aim of the present study was to develop an accurate prediction model of PCAD risk that allows early intervention., METHODS: We performed retrospective analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and traditional cardiovascular risk factors (TCRFs) for 131 PCAD patients and 187 controls. The data was used to construct classifiers for the prediction of PCAD risk with the machine learning (ML) algorithms LogisticRegression (LRC), RandomForestClassifier (RFC) and GradientBoostingClassifier (GBC) in scikit-learn. Three quarters of the participants were randomly grouped into a training dataset and the rest into a test dataset. The performance of classifiers was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity and concordance index. R packages were used to construct nomograms., RESULTS: Three optimized feature combinations (FCs) were identified: RS-DT-FC1 (rs2259816, rs1378577, rs10757274, rs4961, smoking, hyperlipidemia, glucose, triglycerides), RS-DT-FC2 (rs1378577, rs10757274, smoking, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, glucose, triglycerides) and RS-DT-FC3 (rs1169313, rs5082, rs9340799, rs10757274, rs1152002, smoking, hyperlipidemia, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol). These were able to build the classifiers with an AUC >0.90 and sensitivity >0.90. The nomograms built with RS-DT-FC1, RS-DT-FC2 and RS-DT-FC3 had a concordance index of 0.94, 0.94 and 0.90, respectively, when validated with the test dataset, and 0.79, 0.82 and 0.79 when validated with the training dataset. Manual prediction of the test data with the three nomograms resulted in an AUC of 0.89, 0.92 and 0.83, respectively, and a sensitivity of 0.92, 0.96 and 0.86, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: The selection of suitable features determines the performance of ML models. RS-DT-FC2 may be a suitable FC for building a high-performance prediction model of PCAD with good sensitivity and accuracy. The nomograms allow practical scoring and interpretation of each predictor and may be useful for clinicians in determining the risk of PCAD. Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

Improving the efficacy of resting MPI in diagnosing CAD has important clinical significance for patients with contraindications to stress. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a model predicting obstructive CAD in suspected CAD patients, based on rest-only MPI and cardiovascular risk factors., METHODS: A consecutive retrospective cohort of 260 suspected CAD patients who underwent rest-only gated SPECT MPI and coronary angiography was constructed. All enrolled patients had stress MPI contraindications. Clinical data such as age and gender were collected. Automated quantitative analysis software QPS and QGS were used to evaluate myocardial perfusion and function parameters. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multivariable logistic regression were used to select the variables and build the prediction model., RESULTS: Among the enrolled 260 patients with suspected CAD, there were 95 (36.5%, 95/260) patients with obstructive CAD. The prediction model was presented in the form of a nomogram and developed based on selected predictors, including age, sex, SRS >= 4, SMS >= 2, STS >= 2, hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. The AUC of the prediction model was 0.795 (95% CI: 0.741-0.843), which was better than the traditional models. The AUC calculated by enhanced bootstrapping validation (500 bootstrap resamples) was 0.785. Subsequently, the calibration curve (intercept = - 0.106; slope = 0.843) showed a good calibration of the model.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is an independent risk factor for AF. The cardioembolic stroke (CS) risk is increased when both conditions coexist. Whether angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) genetic variants predict increased risks AF and CS in Uygur patients with T2D remain elusive. Method(s): A total of 547 Uygur subjects (272 controls and 275 T2D patients) were recruited to the study from south Xinjiang. Eight ACE2 variants were identified by MassARRAY system. Result(s): ACE2 rs2074192 (CC, adjusted RR = 2.55, 95% CI 1.35-4.80, P = 0.004), rs4240157 (CC + CT, adjusted RR = 2.26, 95% CI 1.27-4.04, P = 0.006) and rs4646188 (TT, adjusted RR = 2.37, 95% CI 1.16-4.86, P = 0.018) were associated with higher AF risk. ACE2 rs4240157 (CC + CT, adjusted RR = 2.68, 95% CI 1.36-5.27, P = 0.004) and rs4646188 (TT, adjusted RR = 2.56, 95% CI 1.06-6.20, P = 0.037) were further associated with higher CS risk. The 3 ACE2 variants were related to larger left atrial end-systolic diameter (LAD) (all P < 0.05), but not all of the 3 ACE2 variants were related to increased levels of serum sodium (rs4240157 and rs4646188, all P < 0.05), HsCRP (rs4240157 and rs4646188, all P < 0.05) as well as decreased serum potassium levels (rs2074192 and rs4646188, all P < 0.05). The 3 ACE2 variants exhibited heterogeneity on circulating RAAS activation. In particular, ACE2 rs4646188 was associated with higher levels of ACE (P = 0.017 and 0.037), Ang I (P = 0.002 and 0.001), Ang II (both P < 0.001) and ALD (P = 0.005 and 0.011). Conclusion(s): These results indicated ACE2 rs4646188 was associated with increased risk of AF and CS among diabetic patients in Uygurs, which could be a promising genetic predisposition marker for early and personalized prevention strategies for the aforementioned clinical pathologies.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).","Authors":"Liu, C.; Pei, J.; Lai, Y.; Guan, T.; Zeyaweiding, A.; Maimaiti, T.; Zhao, H.; Shen, Y.","Publisher":"BMC Cardiovascular Disorders","Issue":"1","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12872-021-01915-9","Pages":"103","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) variant rs4646188"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":9,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":3,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":43,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":47,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":49,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":52,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":2153,"Title":"The variants at FLNA and FLNB contribute to the susceptibility of hypertension and stroke with differentially expressed mRNA","Year":2021,"Country":"","Abstract":"Background: Filamin A and filamin B were involved in vascular development and remodeling. Herein, it is important to explore the associations of FLNA and FLNB variants with hypertension and stroke. Method(s): The associations of two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at FLNA and five SNPs at FLNB with hypertension and stroke were examined in two case-control studies and a cohort study in Chinese Han population. Risks were estimated as odds ratio (OR) and hazard ratio (HR) by Logistic and Cox regression analysis respectively. In addition, filamin B, FLNA and FLNB mRNA expression were measured. Result(s): In the case-control study of hypertension, FLNA rs2070816 (CT + TT vs. CC) and rs2070829 (CG + GG vs. CC) were significantly associated with hypertension in <55 years group (OR = 1.338, P = 0.018; OR = 1.615, P = 0.005) and FLNB rs839240 (AG + GG vs. AA) was significantly associated with hypertension in females (OR = 0.828, P = 0.041) and nonsmokers (OR = 0.829, P = 0.020). In the follow-up study, rs2070829 GG genotype carriers presented a higher risk of hypertension than CC/CG in males (HR = 1.737, P = 0.014) and smokers (HR = 1.949, P = 0.012). In the case-control study of stroke, FLNB rs1131356 variation was significantly associated with ischemic stroke (IS) and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), ORs of additive model were 1.342 and 1.451, with P values of 0.001 and 0.007. The FLNA transcript 2, FLNB transcript 3, transcript 4 mRNA, and filamin B expression levels were significantly different between IS cases and hypertension controls and among the genotypes of rs839240 in hypertensive individuals (P < 0.05).

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is an important risk factor for cardiovascular death. However, only a few studies investigated the correlations between the AST/ALT ratio and PAD. We analyzed data from 10 900 patients with hypertension from the Chinese Hypertension Registry Study; 350 patients had PAD (prevalence 3.2%). After adjusting for potential confounders, the AST/ALT ratio was independently and positively associated with risk of PAD (OR: 1.31, 95% CI, 1.13-1.59), and a significant increased risk of PAD for the third AST/ALT ratio tertile (T3) compared with the first tertile (T1; OR: 1.49, 95% CI, 1.09-2.04, Ptrend = .005) was found. Moreover, when we combined T1 and T2 into one group and used it as a reference group, the risk of PAD increased with the increase in AST/ALT; the risk ratio was 1.52 (95% CI, 1.20-1.95). A higher AST/ALT ratio (>=1.65) was associated with PAD risk in Chinese adults with hypertension.

We further modeled with ten most important clinical features without compromising the predictive performance. The key features positively associated with stroke include age, cigarette smoking, tobacco smoking, Caucasian or African American race, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, asthma history; the negatively associated feature is the family income. The nomogram based on these key features achieved good performances (AUROC between 0.753 and 0.822) on the test set, the NHANES 2007-08, 2017-18, and the UK Biobank.

However, the relationship between plasma homocysteine (Hcy) concentration and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) has not been completely characterized. The aim of the present study was to determine the relationship between plasma Hcy concentration and new-onset PAD and to assess the effects of combinations of Hcy and traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Patients and Methods: We conducted a prospective community-based cohort study of 3119 Chinese participants who did not have PAD at baseline, with a median follow-up period of 2.30 years. We used multivariate logistic regression models to evaluate the relationship between high Hcy (>=10micromol/L) and new-onset PAD. The effects of combinations of high Hcy and traditional cardiovascular risk factors were assessed using logistic regression analysis. Result(s): After adjustment for 14 covariates, high Hcy concentration was significantly associated with new-onset PAD (odds ratio [OR]=2.08, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.-08-4.03, P=0.030). Smokers with high Hcy concentration were substantially more likely to have new-onset PAD than non-smokers with normal Hcy concentration (OR=4.44, 95% CI: 1.77-11.12, P=0.001). The effect of diabetes on PAD became significant when present in combination with high Hcy concentration (OR=3.67, 95% CI: 1.25-10.80, P=0.018). Participants with both elevated Hcy levels and older age had the highest risk of new-onset PAD (OR=4.28, 95% CI: 1.83-10.01, P<0.001). With regard to the joint effect of Hcy and hypertension, dyslipidemia or sex, there was also a trend towards increased risk across four different groups (P for trend=0.026, 0.035, 0.016, respectively). Conclusion(s): High plasma Hcy concentration independently predicts the incidence of PAD. Furthermore, there is a joint effect of high Hcy concentration and traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, diabetes and aging on the incidence of PAD.Copyright © 2020 Liu et al.","Authors":"Liu, M.; Fan, F.; Liu, B.; Jia, J.; Jiang, Y.; Sun, P.; He, D.; Liu, J.; Li, Y.; Huo, Y.; Li, J.; Zhang, Y.","Publisher":"Diabetes, Metabolic Syndrome and Obesity: Targets and Therapy","Issue":"Not Available","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.2147/DMSO.S267122","Pages":"3383-3393","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"homocysteine (Hcy)"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":37,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":43,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":47,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":58,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":2188,"Title":"Gut-microbiome-based predictive model for ST-elevation myocardial infarction in young male patients","Year":2022,"Country":"","Abstract":"Background: ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in young male patients accounts for a significant proportion of total heart attack events. Therefore, clinical awareness and screening for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in asymptomatic patients at a young age is required. The gut microbiome is potentially involved in the pathogenesis of STEMI. The aim of the current study is to develop an early risk prediction model based on the gut microbiome and clinical parameters for this population. Method(s): A total of 81 young males (age < 44 years) were enrolled in this study. Forty-one young males with STEMI were included in the case group, and the control group included 40 young non-coronary artery disease (CAD) males. To identify the differences in gut microbiome markers between these two groups, 16S rRNA-based gut microbiome sequencing was performed using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Further, a nomogram and corresponding web page were constructed. The diagnostic efficacy and practicability of the model were analyzed using K-fold cross-validation, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). Result(s): Compared to the control group, a significant decrease in tendency regarding alpha and beta diversity was observed in patients in the case group and identified as a significantly altered gut microbiome represented by Streptococcus and Prevotella. Regarding clinical parameters, compared to the control group, the patients in the case group had a higher body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure (SBP), triglyceride (TG), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and low blood urea nitrogen (BUN). Additionally, BMI and SBP were significantly (p<0.05) positively correlated with Streptococcus and [Ruminococcus]. Further, BMI and SBP were significantly (p<0.05) negatively correlated with Prevotella and Megasphaera. A significant negative correlation was only observed between Prevotella and AST (p < 0.05). Finally, an early predictive nomogram and corresponding web page were constructed based on the gut microbiome and clinical parameters with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.877 and a C-index of 0.911. For the internal validation, the stratified K-fold cross-validation (K = 3) was as follows: AUC value of 0.934. The calibration curves of the model showed good consistency between the actual and predicted probabilities. The DCA results showed that the model had a high net clinical benefit for use in the clinical setting. Conclusion(s): In this study, we combined the gut microbiome and common clinical parameters to construct a prediction model. Our analysis shows that the constructed model is a non-invasive tool with potential clinical application in predicting STEMI in the young males.Copyright © 2022 Liu, Wang, Peng, Ma, Wang, Niu, Hu, Qi, Guo, Ren, Geng, Wang, Song, Hu and Li.","Authors":"Liu, M.; Wang, M.; Peng, T.; Ma, W.; Wang, Q.; Niu, X.; Hu, L.; Qi, B.; Guo, D.; Ren, G.; Geng, J.; Wang, D.; Song, L.; Hu, J.; Li, Y.","Publisher":"Frontiers in Microbiology","Issue":"Not Available","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2022.1031878","Pages":"1031878","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"model with gut microbiome & clinical parameters"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":3,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":23,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":42,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":47,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":49,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":50,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":52,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":54,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":56,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":2199,"Title":"Neutrophil to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio predicts adverse cardiovascular outcomes in subjects with pre-diabetes: a large cohort study from China","Year":2022,"Country":"","Abstract":"Background: This study aimed to examine whether the neutrophil to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (NHR) can predict cardiovascular outcomes in normoglycemic individuals with elevated fasting glucose levels. Method(s): A total of 130,801 participants with normal blood glucose levels were enrolled in the Kailuan study. Participants were categorized according to NHR quartiles and further divided into normal glucose regulation (NGR) and pre-diabetes (pre-DM) subgroups. The follow-up endpoint was major adverse cardiovascular events (CVE), including stroke and myocardial infarction. Result(s): Over a median of 12.53 (8.95-13.08) years of follow-up, subjects with NHR levels in the highest quartile experienced more CVE than those with NHR levels in the lowest quartile. Multivariate Cox analyses showed that continuous changes in NHR (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-1.28) and the highest quartile of NHR (hazard ratio, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.21-1.39) were independent predictors of CVE (all P < 0.001). Furthermore, when participants were categorized by both NHR quartile and glucose metabolism status, the NHR level in the highest quartile plus pre-DM group was associated with a 1.60-fold (95% CI, 1.38-1.86; P < 0.001] higher risk of CVE than that in the lowest quartile plus normoglycemic group. Significantly, the addition of NHR only, presence of pre-DM only, or combination of NHR and pre-DM to the prediction algorithm, including traditional risk factors, improved the C-statistic by 0.19, 0.05, and 0.23 (all P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Elevated NHR or fasting blood glucose level were independently associated with a higher risk of CVE among normoglycemic individuals.

However,the roles of GWAS-susceptibility loci in stroke prognosis are just beginning. The present study aimed to examine whether these GWAS-linked loci polymorphisms are associated with ischemic stroke recurrence in a Chinese population. Method(s): We genotyped six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (9p21: rs2383207 and rs4977574; 12p13: rs12425791 and rs11833579; PDE4D: rs966221; and ALOX5AP: rs1050391) in four GWAS-reported ischemic stroke risk genes in 657 patients. Result(s): The risk of recurrent stroke was significantly associated with PDE4D rs966221 in the dominant model (p = 0.027)and recessive model (p = 0.027). Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier analyses indicated no significant difference in the rate of recurrent stroke among the three genotypes of other five SNPs. Cox regression analysis showed that the GA + GG genotype within the rs966221 polymorphism had a 1.399-fold risk for stoke recurrence (95% confidence interval = 1.038-1.886; p = 0.027). Stratified analysis revealed that the increased recurrence risk of PDE4D rs966221 was more prominent in the large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) subgroup. Conclusion(s): The reults of the present study demonstrate that PDE4D rs966221 may be a valuable biomarker for predicting the recurrent risks of patient with the LAA-IS and adds to our knowledge of the genetic basis of recurrent stroke risk.Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Authors":"Liu, X.; Wang, Q.; Zhu, R.","Publisher":"Journal of Gene Medicine","Issue":"1","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jgm.3264","Pages":"e3264","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"GWAS identified SNPs in stroke risk genes 9p21 & 12p13 & PDE4D & ALOX5AP"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":10,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":3,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":18,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":42,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":47,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":55,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":2206,"Title":"New genetic variants associated with major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndromes and treated with clopidogrel and aspirin","Year":2021,"Country":"","Abstract":"Although a few studies have reported the effects of several polymorphisms on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), these genotypes account for only a small fraction of the variation and evidence is insufficient. This study aims to identify new genetic variants associated with MACE end point during the 18-month follow-up period by a two-stage large-scale sequencing data, including high-depth whole exome sequencing of 168 patients in the discovery cohort and high-depth targeted sequencing of 1793 patients in the replication cohort. We discovered eight new genotypes and their genes associated with MACE in patients with ACS, including MYOM2 (rs17064642), WDR24 (rs11640115), NECAB1 (rs74569896), EFR3A (rs4736529), AGAP3 (rs75750968), ZDHHC3 (rs3749187), ECHS1 (rs140410716), and KRTAP10-4 (rs201441480). Notably, the expressions of MYOM2 and ECHS1 are downregulated in both animal models and patients with phenotypes related to MACE. Importantly, we developed the first superior classifier for predicting 18-month MACE and achieved high predictive performance (AUC ranged between 0.92 and 0.94 for three machine-learning methods). Our findings shed light on the pathogenesis of cardiovascular outcomes and may help the clinician to make a decision on the therapeutic intervention for ACS patients. Copyright © 2021.

The general data of the subjects in the two groups were collected. The serum miR-106 level of the subjects in the two groups was detected by fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the level of MYL4 was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The expression of miR-106 and MYL4 in the myocardium was observed by immunohistochemistry. The relationship between the levels of serum miR-106 and MYL4 and the prevalence of atrial fibrillation and the score of atrial fibrillation thromboembolism risk stratification scoring system (cha2ds2) was compared between the two groups. The relationship between serum level of miR-106 and prognosis of patients with atrial fibrillation was analyzed., Results: The systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and left anterior descending artery (LAD) in the atrial fibrillation group were significantly higher than those in the control group, while HDL-C and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were significantly lower than those in the control group (P < 0.01). The level of serum miR-106 in patients with atrial fibrillation was significantly higher than that in the control group, whereas the level of MYL4 was significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.01). miR-106 was mainly localized in the cytoplasm, and the positive expression rate of miR-106 was 71.43% (81/115) in patients with atrial fibrillation and 21.74% (25/115) in patients with sinus rhythm. MYL4 was mainly located in the cell membrane and the positive expression rate of MYL4 was 24.35% (28/115) in patients with atrial fibrillation and 64.35% (74/115) in patients with sinus rhythm. With the increase of the severity of atrial fibrillation, the level of serum miR-106 gradually increased and the level of MYL4 gradually decreased, which were statistically significant compared with the control group (P < 0.05). With the increase of miR-106 level and the decrease of MYL4 level, the prevalence of atrial fibrillation gradually increased. With the increase of cha2ds2 score, the level of serum miR-106 increased and the level of MYL4 decreased. The survival rate of patients with miR - 106 <= 1.96 was significantly higher than that of patients with miR - 106 > 1.96. The survival rate of patients with MYL4 >= 0.24 was significantly higher than that of patients with MYL4 < 0.24. At the same time, TC and LDL-C were included in the analysis. The results showed that the survival rate of patients with TC <= 4.5 mmol/L was significantly higher than that of patients with TC > 4.5 mmol/L, and that of patients with LDL-C <= 2.6 mmol/L was significantly higher than that of patients with LDL-C > 2.6 mmol/L., Conclusion: Serum miR-106 and MYL4 levels are closely related to the prevalence of atrial fibrillation, which can reflect the risk of thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation and can be used as a biological indicator to predict the prognosis of patients with atrial fibrillation.

Design Prospective cohort study. Setting UK Biobank, UK. Participants 77 004 men and women (40-70 years) recruited between 2006 and 2010. Main outcome measures A polygenic risk score was created from 300 single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with CVD. Cox proportional HRs were used to estimate independent effects of diet quality and genetic risk on all-cause mortality, CVD mortality, MI and stroke risk. Dietary intake (Oxford WebQ) was used to calculate Recommended Food Score (RFS), Healthy Diet Indicator (HDI) and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS). Results New all-cause (n=2409) and CVD (n=364) deaths and MI (n=1141) and stroke (n=748) events were identified during mean follow-ups of 7.9 and 7.8 years, respectively. The adjusted HR associated with one-point higher RFS for all-cause mortality was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.94 to 0.98), CVD mortality was 0.94 (95% CI: 0.90 to 0.98), MI was 0.97 (95% CI: 0.95 to 1.00) and stroke was 0.94 (95% CI: 0.91 to 0.98). The adjusted HR for all-cause mortality associated with one-point higher HDI and MDS was 0.97 (95% CI: 0.93 to 0.99) and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.91 to 0.98), respectively. The adjusted HR associated with one-point higher MDS for stroke was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.87 to 1.00). There was little evidence of associations between HDI and risk of CVD mortality, MI or stroke. There was evidence of an interaction between diet quality and genetic risk score for MI. Conclusion Higher diet quality predicted lower risk of all-cause mortality, independent of genetic risk. Higher RFS was also associated with lower risk of CVD mortality and MI. These findings demonstrate the benefit of following a healthy diet, regardless of genetic risk.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

However, the influence of CYP4V2 polymorphisms on the susceptibility to ischemic stroke (IS) remains undetermined. Method(s): We selected and genotyped five polymorphisms of CYP4V2 in 575 cases and 575 controls to test whether CYP4V2 variants were associated with the risk for IS in a Chinese Han population. Genotyping of CYP4V2 polymorphisms was performed using the Agena MassARRAY platform. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between CYP4V2 polymorphisms and IS risk by calculating odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence interval (CI). False-positive report probability analysis was applied to assess the noteworthy relationship of the significant findings. Result(s): CYP4V2 rs1398007 might be a risk factor for IS (OR = 1.34, 95% CI 1.05-1.71, p = 0.009). Specially, confounding factors (age, gender, smoking and drinking status) might affect the relationship between rs1398007 and IS susceptibility. Moreover, rs1053094 and rs56413992 were associated with IS risk in males. Multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis showed the combination of rs13146272 and rs3736455 had the strongest interaction effect (information gain value of 0.40%).

We conducted a Mendelian randomization (MR) study to evaluate the association of genetic variants related to tobacco and alcohol use with AF. Method(s): Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to smoking initiation (N = 374), age at initiation of regular smoking (N = 10), cigarettes per day (N = 55), and smoking cessation (N = 24) were derived from a genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of tobacco use (N = 1.2 million individuals).

The genetically matching instrumented variables were obtained from the GWAS of AF (N = 588,190 individuals). The estimates between tobacco and alcohol use and AF were combined by inverse-variance weighted (IVW), simple median, weighted median, MR-robust adjusted profile score method, MR-PRESSO, and multivariable MR. Result(s): A total of 65,446 AF patients and 522,744 referents were included. In the IVW analysis, the odds ratio per one-unit increase of smoking initiation was 1.11 (95% CI, 1.06-1.16; P = 3.35 x 10-6) for AF.

In the first stage, whole mitochondrial genomes of 52 IS patients and 55 controls were sequenced by next-generation sequencing. Fifty-three mtDNA mutation sites which may be related to the pathogenesis of IS were discovered. Nine unreported mtDNA variation sites were found for the first time. In the second larger Chinese cohort, we confirmed that m.T195C and m.T12338C in the mitochondrial D-loop region were the protective factors of IS, especially m.T195C and m.C311T in the LAA subtype.

Due to their clinical significance, we explored disease associations of the APOE genotypes using a hypothesis-free, data-driven, phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) approach., METHODS: We used data from the UK Biobank to screen for associations between APOE genotypes and over 950 disease outcomes using genotype epsilon3epsilon3 as a reference. Data was restricted to 337,484 white British participants (aged 37-73 years)., FINDINGS: After correction for multiple testing, PheWAS analyses identified associations with 37 outcomes, representing 18 distinct diseases. As expected, epsilon3epsilon4 and epsilon4epsilon4 genotypes associated with increased odds of AD (p <= 7.6 x 10-46), hypercholesterolaemia (p <= 7.1 x 10-17) and ischaemic heart disease (p <= 2.3 x 10-4), while epsilon2epsilon3 provided protection for the latter two conditions (p <= 3.7 x 10-10) compared to epsilon3epsilon3. In contrast, epsilon4-associated disease protection was seen against obesity, chronic airway obstruction, type 2 diabetes, gallbladder disease, and liver disease (all p <= 5.2 x 10-4) while epsilon2epsilon2 homozygosity increased risks of peripheral vascular disease, thromboembolism, arterial aneurysm, peptic ulcer, cervical disorders, and hallux valgus (all p <= 6.1 x 10-4). Sensitivity analyses using brain neuroimaging, blood biochemistry, anthropometric, and spirometric biomarkers supported the PheWAS findings on APOE associations with respective disease outcomes., INTERPRETATION: PheWAS confirms strong associations between APOE and AD, hypercholesterolaemia, and ischaemic heart disease, and suggests potential epsilon4-associated disease protection and harmful effects of the epsilon2epsilon2 genotype, for several conditions., FUNDING: National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia.

Methods and Results: A total of 1245 women from the general population free of heart failure (HF) and atrial fibrillation had an echocardiographic examination performed including tissue Doppler imaging. In this subset, 747 women had images eligible for strain analysis. Endpoint was a composite of acute myocardial infarction, HF, and cardiovascular death. During follow-up (median 12.5 years), 162 women (13.0%) reached the composite outcome. These women had higher left ventricular (LV) mass index (LVMI), more LV hypertrophy, lower E/A, higher E/e', larger LV dimensions, and longer deceleration time. LVMI and e' remained as significant predictors of the composite outcome [LVMI: hazard ratio (HR) 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-1.17, P = 0.004, per 5 g/m2 increase] (e': HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.07-2.20, P = 0.020, per 1 cm/s decrease) after adjusting for age, hypertension, systolic blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, total cholesterol, smoking status, prevalent ischaemic heart disease, LV ejection fraction, E/e', E, E/A, interventricular septum thickness in diastole, left ventricular posterior wall in diastole, a', body surface area, and pro-brain natriuretic peptide. GLS was not an independent predictor of outcome after multivariable adjustment. Conclusion(s): The degree of LV hypertrophy assessed as LVMI and diastolic dysfunction evaluated by e' are associated with adverse cardiovascular outcome in women from the general population.Copyright © 2020 Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

Summary statistics for gene-CHD associations were obtained from 3 databases: the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D consortium (60,801 cases; 123,504 control subjects), UK Biobank (25,306 cases; 462,011 control subjects), and FinnGen study (7,123 cases; 89,376 control subjects). For each exposure, MR analyses were performed per outcome database and were subsequently meta-analyzed., RESULTS: Among an analytic sample of 768,121 individuals (93,230 cases), genetically predicted circulating antioxidants were not causally associated with CHD risk. For absolute antioxidants, the odds ratio for CHD ranged between 0.94 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.63 to 1.41) for retinol and 1.03 (95% CI: 0.97 to 1.10) for beta-carotene per unit increase in ln-transformed antioxidant values. For metabolites, the odds ratio ranged between 0.93 (95% CI: 0.82 to 1.06) for gamma-tocopherol and 1.01 (95% CI: 0.95 to 1.08) for ascorbate per 10-fold increase in metabolite levels., CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from our study did not support a protective effect of genetic predisposition to high dietary-derived antioxidant levels on CHD risk. Therefore, it is unlikely that taking antioxidants to increase blood antioxidants levels will have a clinical benefit for the prevention of primary CHD.

Variations in genes encoding the constituent proteins of NLRP3 inflammasome can alter the risk of IS., OBJECTIVE: We investigated the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathogenesis of IS by establishing associations between combined polymorphisms of caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 8 (CARD8) rs2043211 and NLRP3 rs10754558 and the susceptibility to IS in a Chinese population., METHODS: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CARD8 rs2043211 and NLRP3 rs10754558 were analyzed using TaqMan SNP genotyping assays in patients with IS (n=234) and healthy controls (n=115). Logistic regression analysis was carried out to evaluate potential interactions between CARD8 and NLRP3., RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, there were no significant differences in the minor allele frequency (MAF) and the genotype frequency of NLRP3 rs10754558 or CARD8 rs2043211 in patients with IS(P>0.05). After stratification by gender, there was an increased risk for IS in men carrying heterozygous CARD8 rs2043211 when a co-dominant genetic model was applied (P=0.021, OR=3.83[1.22-12.03]). Logistic regression analysis indicated that men carrying both CARD8 rs2043211 AT and NLRP3 rs10754558 CG had a significantly higher risk of IS (P=0.046, OR=7.116[1.033-49.044])., CONCLUSIONS: Nucleotide variations in the genes encoding NLRP3 inflammasome proteins may be important to IS, and men carrying CARD8 rs2043211 and NLRP3 rs10754558, both heterozygous, confer a higher risk of IS.

Due to the lower rate of controlled diabetes in China compared to that in developed countries, there is a higher incidence of serious cardiovascular complications, especially acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The aim of this study was to establish a potent risk predictive model in the economically disadvantaged northwest region of China, which could predict the probability of new-onset ACS in patients with T2DM., METHODS: Of 456 patients with T2DM admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University from January 2018 to January 2019 and included in this study, 270 had no ACS, while 186 had newly diagnosed ACS. Overall, 32 demographic characteristics and serum biomarkers of the study patients were analysed. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression was used to select variables, while the multivariate logistic regression was used to establish the predictive model that was presented using a nomogram. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the discriminatory capacity of the model. A calibration plot and Hosmer-Lemeshow test were used for the calibration of the predictive model, while the decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to evaluate its clinical validity., RESULTS: After random sampling, 319 and 137 T2DM patients were included in the training and validation sets, respectively. The predictive model included age, body mass index, diabetes duration, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, serum uric acid, lipoprotein(a), hypertension history and alcohol drinking status as predictors. The AUC of the predictive model and that of the internal validation set was 0.830 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.786-0.874] and 0.827 (95% CI 0.756-0.899), respectively. The predictive model showed very good fitting degree, and DCA demonstrated a clinically effective predictive model., CONCLUSIONS: A potent risk predictive model was established, which is of great value for the secondary prevention of diabetes. Weight loss, lowering of SBP and blood uric acid levels and appropriate control for DBP may significantly reduce the risk of new-onset ACS in T2DM patients in Northwest China.","Authors":"Lyu, Jun; Li, Zhiying; Wei, Huiyi; Liu, Dandan; Chi, Xiaoxian; Gong, Da-Wei; Zhao, Qingbin","Publisher":"Acta diabetologica","Issue":"6","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00592-020-01484-x","Pages":"705-713","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"model with demographics & clinical features"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":28,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":43,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":47,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":49,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":50,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":52,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":2315,"Title":"Body Mass Index and the Risk of Atrial Fibrillation: A Mendelian Randomization Study","Year":2022,"Country":"","Abstract":"Although observational studies have shown positive associations between body mass index (BMI) and the risk of atrial fibrillation (AF), the causal relationship is still uncertain owing to the susceptibility to confounding and reverse causation. This study aimed to examine the potential causality of BMI on AF by conducting a two-sample Mendelian randomization (TSMR) study. Method(s): The independent genetic variants associated with BMI (n = 303) at the genome-wide sig-nificant level were derived as instrumental variables (IV) from the Genetic Investigation of An-thropometric Traits (GIANT) consortium consisting of 681,275 individuals of European ancestry. We then derived the outcome data from a GWAS meta-analysis comprised of 60,620 cases and 970,216 controls of European ancestry. The TSMR analyses were performed in five methods, namely inverse variance weighted (IVW) method, MR-Egger regression, the weighted median estimator (WME), the generalized summary data-based Mendelian randomization (GSMR), and the robust adjusted profile score (RAPS), to investigate whether BMI was causally associated with the risk of AF. Result(s): We found a genetically determined 1-standard deviation (SD) increment of BMI causally increased a 42.5% risk of AF (OR = 1.425; 95% CI, 1.346 to 1.509) based on the IVW method, which was consistent with the results of MR-Egger regression, WME, GSMR, as well as RAPS. The Mendelian randomization assumptions did not seem to be violated. Conclusion(s): This study provides evidence that higher BMI causally increased the risk of AF, suggesting control of BMI and obesity for prevention of AF.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is the most serious type of CAD. Myocardial infarction (MI) association transcript (MIAT) has demonstrated that it plays an important role in AMI. Purpose(s): To investigate the association between MIAT promoter polymorphisms and AMI in Chinese Han population. Method(s): A total of 212 AMI patients and 218 healthy controls were recruited. The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)-MIAT promoter polymorphisms (single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)) were obtained using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing techniques. Chi-square test was used to analyze the allele and genotype frequencies of each SNP in two groups. Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the association of each SNP with AMI. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) and haplotype analysis were performed using SHEsis software. A JASPAR database search predicts transcription factors transition of linked polymorphism in MIAT promoter. Result(s): Ten SNPs were found, including rs56371714, rs55892869, rs151057042, rs2157598, rs150465374, rs5761664, rs8142890, rs5752375, rs9608515 and rs1055293700, whereas rs1055293700 was found only in the control group. Single and logistic regression analysis showed that there was a significant correlation between rs5752375 and rs9608515 polymorphisms and AMI, while other sites had no relationship with AMI. These MI association polymorphisms may change the binding sites with transcription factor.

It remains uncertain whether low SHBG is prospectively predictive of stroke risk, particularly in women. We investigated whether SHBG is associated with risk of incident ischemic stroke (IS) among women in the WHI (Women's Health Initiative). Methods-From an observational cohort of 161 808 postmenopausal women enrolled in the WHI at 40 sites across the United States from 1993 to 1998, we identified 13 192 participants free of prevalent stroke at baseline who were included in an ancillary study that measured serum SHBG. We used Cox proportional hazards regression, stratified by SHBG measurement assay, to assess IS risk across quintiles of SHBG (Q1-Q5), adjusting first for demographic variables (model 1), additionally for body mass index, hypertension, alcohol use, and smoking status (model 2), and for physical activity and reproductive risk factors (model 3). In sensitivity analyses, potential mediators (diabetes mellitus status, levels of estradiol, testosterone, and CRP [C-reactive protein]) were included. Results-Of 13 192 participants (mean age, 62.5 years; 67.4% non-Hispanic white, 18.5% black, 7.6% Hispanic, and 5.0% Asian), after following for an average of 11.6 years, 768 IS events were adjudicated. Compared with the highest quintile of SHBG levels (referent), women in the lowest SHBG quintile had a higher risk of IS in all 3 multivariable models (model 1: Hazard ratio, 1.88 [95% CI, 1.47-2.41]; model 2: Hazard ratio, 1.69 [95% CI, 1.30-2.20]; model 3: Hazard ratio, 1.61 [95% CI, 1.19-2.19]; trend tests P<0.05 for all models). Including potential mediators such as diabetes mellitus, estradiol, and testosterone in the models attenuated but did not eliminate significant inverse associations between SHBG and IS. Conclusions-In this prospective cohort of postmenopausal women, there was a statistically significant inverse association between serum SHBG levels and IS risk, which supports the notion that SHBG could be used as a risk stratification tool for predicting IS in women.Copyright © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Methods and Results Cox proportional hazards were used to create a base model formed by 20 variables. The discriminatory ability of the base model was compared with that of NT-proBNP alone and with NT-proBNP added, using C-statistics. We studied 5509 patients (with complete data) of 8561 patients with T2DM and cardiovascular and/or chronic kidney disease who were enrolled in the ALTITUDE (Aliskiren in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiorenal Endpoints) trial. During a median 2.6-year follow-up period, 469 patients died and 768 had a cardiovascular composite outcome (cardiovascular death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, or heart failure hospitalization). NT-proBNP alone was as discriminatory as the base model for predicting death (C-statistic, 0.745 versus 0.744, P=0.95) and the cardiovascular composite outcome (C-statistic, 0.723 versus 0.731, P=0.37).

Conclusions In high-risk patients with T2DM, NT-proBNP by itself demonstrated discriminatory ability similar to a multivariable model in predicting both death and cardiovascular events and should be considered for risk stratification.

Considering the involvement of platelet abnormalities, such as defective aggregation and adhesion, in the cardiovascular-related disorders, genetic variations in human platelet alloantigens (HPA) have been implicated in the CAD susceptibility. Herein, we intended to determine the association of HPA-1 to -6, -9, and -15 biallelic polymorphisms with CAD in an Iranian population., METHODS: In this retrospective case-control study, 200 CAD subjects and 100 matched healthy individuals were enrolled. DNA samples were isolated from peripheral blood samples and genotyping of HPA polymorphisms was accomplished using polymerase chain reaction-sequence-specific primers., RESULTS: The alleles and genotypes of studied HPA polymorphisms were equally distributed among cases and controls and therefore no statistically significant differences were detected. Univariate analysis identified no association of combined haplotypes with CAD risk. However, multivariate analysis showed a positive association of the HPA1b/2a/3b haplotype with CAD after adjustment for some covariates (including BMI, TG, LDL, FBS and blood pressure) that conferred a CAD susceptibility haplotype (P = 0.015; OR = 2.792; 95% CI 1.45-8.59)., CONCLUSIONS: Although alleles, genotypes, and haplotypes of HPA polymorphisms were not associated with CAD risk, HPA1b/2a/3b haplotype was found to be a dependent disease risk haplotype in Iranian population after correcting for confounding factors.","Authors":"Malakootikhah, Farideh; Naghavi, Hossein; Firouzabadi, Negar; Maadani, Mohsen; Shafiei, Massoumeh; Tajik, Nader","Publisher":"BMC cardiovascular disorders","Issue":"1","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12872-021-01892-z","Pages":"68","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"human platelet alloantigens (HPA) 1b/2a/3b haplotype"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":20,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":44,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":47,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":58,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":2383,"Title":"PPBP gene as a biomarker for coronary heart disease risk in postmenopausal Thai women","Year":2022,"Country":"","Abstract":"Background: Estrogen is an important ovarian hormone with anti-atherogenic and cardioprotective effects. Postmenopausal women have lower estrogen levels, associated with significantly higher risks of coronary heart disease (CHD) and CHD-related death. Effective biomarkers for the diagnosis, prediction, and treatment of CHD are needed to address this problem and thus reduce the mortality due to CHD in postmenopausal women. We recently reported that the PPBP and DEFA1/DEFA3 genes may be feasible synergistic biomarkers for CHD risk in Thai men with hyperlipidemia. The PPBP gene encodes pro-platelet basic protein (PPBP) from activated platelets, and DEFA1/DEFA3 encodes human neutrophil peptides (HNP) 1-3, mainly produced by activated neutrophils. Both platelets and neutrophils are involved in chronic inflammation during the development of atherogenesis and CHD. This study investigated the potential roles of PPBP and DEFA1/DEFA3 and their proteins as biomarkers for CHD risk in postmenopausal Thai women., Methods: This cross-sectional study enrolled 90 postmenopausal Thai women, including 12 healthy controls (N), 18 patients with hyperlipidemia (H), and 21 patients diagnosed with CHD. The remaining 39 women were receiving cholesterol-lowering drugs for hyperlipidemia (HD) were excluded from the study. All CHD patients underwent coronary bypass grafting or coronary angioplasty. PPBP and DEFA1/DEFA3 mRNA expression levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from heparinized blood were determined by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Levels of PPBP and HNP-1-3 proteins in corresponding plasma samples were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Differences in parameters were compared among groups and correlations between parameters and clinical manifestations were analyzed., Results: PPBP mRNA and protein levels were significantly increased in the CHD group compared with the N and H groups. In contrast, DEFA1/DEFA3 mRNA and HNP-1-3 protein levels did not differ significantly among the groups. None of the levels were associated with any of the clinical parameters analyzed in this study., Conclusion: The results indicate that gene and protein expression levels of PPBP, but not DEFA1/DEFA3, and HNP-1-3, may be feasible biomarkers for assessing CHD risk in postmenopausal Thai women with hyperlipidemia.

Many studies have illustrated that dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, smoking and excessive drinking are the traditional risk factors for stroke. This study aimed to observe the relationship between CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 variants and stroke risk in the Chinese population. Method(s): Agena MassARRAY Assay was used to genotype four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 477 cases and 480 controls. The chi-square test and logistic-regression analysis were used to explore the relationship between CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 variants and stroke risk. Result(s): Individuals with CYP1A2 rs762551 C was associated with a lower risk of stroke than that of allele A. Age stratification analysis showed that rs762551 was only observed to be associated with a lower risk of stroke in <=64ys age group. After gender stratification analysis, a significant association between rs762551 and stroke risk was found in males, but not in females. The four SNPs were found to be correlated with stroke risk in patients with hypertension, coronary heart disease, cerebral infarction and lacunar infarction.

We analyzed EMPs with apoptotic characteristics and assessed the angiogenic contents of microparticles in the blood of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) according to the presence of coronary artery disease (CAD)., METHODS: A total of 80 participants were recruited and equally classified as (1) healthy without T2D, (2) T2D without cardiovascular complications, (3) T2D and chronic coronary artery disease (CAD), and (4) T2D and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). MPs were isolated from the peripheral circulation, and EMPs were characterized using flow cytometry of CD42 and CD31. CD62E was used to determine EMPs' apoptotic/activation state. MPs content was extracted and profiled using an angiogenesis array., RESULTS: Levels of CD42- CD31 + EMPs were significantly increased in T2D with ACS (257.5 +/- 35.58) when compared to healthy subjects (105.7 +/- 12.96, p < 0.01). There was no significant difference when comparing T2D with and without chronic CAD. The ratio of CD42-CD62 +/CD42-CD31 + EMPs was reduced in all T2D patients, with further reduction in ACS when compared to chronic CAD, reflecting a release by apoptotic endothelial cells. The angiogenic content of the full population of MPs was analyzed. It revealed a significant differential expression of 5 factors in patients with ACS and diabetes, including TGF-beta1, PD-ECGF, platelet factor 4, serpin E1, and thrombospondin 1. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed that those five differentially expressed molecules, mainly TGF-beta1, inhibit key pathways involved in normal endothelial function. Further comparison of the three diabetes groups to healthy controls and diabetes without cardiovascular disease to diabetes with CAD identified networks that inhibit normal endothelial cell function. Interestingly, DDP-IV was the only differentially expressed protein between chronic CAD and ACS in patients with diabetes., CONCLUSION: Our data showed that the release of apoptosis-induced EMPs is increased in diabetes, irrespective of CAD, ACS patients having the highest levels. The protein contents of MPs interact in networks that indicate vascular dysfunction. Copyright © 2022.

We evaluated the lifetime risk at different PRS levels, and the impact on disease onset and on prediction together with clinical risk scores. Compared to having an average PRS, having a high PRS contributed 21% to 38% higher lifetime risk, and 4 to 9 years earlier disease onset. PRSs improved model discrimination over age and sex in type 2 diabetes, atrial fibrillation, breast cancer and prostate cancer, and over clinical risk in type 2 diabetes, breast cancer and prostate cancer. In all diseases, PRSs improved reclassification over clinical thresholds, with the largest net reclassification improvements for early-onset coronary heart disease, atrial fibrillation and prostate cancer.

Subjects were divided into quintiles using a validated polygenic risk score (PRS) for AF. Clinical risk for AF was calculated using the CHARGE-AF model. Kaplan-Meier event rates, adjusted hazard ratios (HRs), C-indices, and net reclassification improvement were used to determine if the addition of the PRS improved prediction compared with clinical risk and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Over 2.3 years, 1018 new AF cases developed. AF PRS predicted a significant risk gradient for AF with a 40% increased risk per 1-SD increase in PRS [HR: 1.40 (1.32-1.49); P < 0.001]. Those with high AF PRS (top 20%) were more than two-fold more likely to develop AF [HR 2.45 (1.99-3.03), P < 0.001] compared with low PRS (bottom 20%). Furthermore, PRS provided an additional gradient of risk stratification on top of the CHARGE-AF clinical risk score, ranging from a 3-year incidence of 1.3% in patients with low clinical and genetic risk to 8.7% in patients with high clinical and genetic risk. The subgroup of patients with high clinical risk, high PRS, and elevated NT-proBNP had an AF risk of 16.7% over 3 years. The C-index with the CHARGE-AF clinical risk score alone was 0.65, which improved to 0.67 (P < 0.001) with the addition of NT-proBNP, and increased further to 0.70 (P < 0.001) with the addition of the PRS., CONCLUSION: In patients with cardiovascular conditions, AF PRS is a strong independent predictor of incident AF that provides complementary predictive value when added to a validated clinical risk score and NT-proBNP.

However, causality cannot be inferred from these associations. Here, we investigated causality by analyzing the associations between genetically influenced antioxidant levels in blood and ischemic stroke using Mendelian randomization. Methods and Results For each circulating antioxidant (vitamins E and C, lycopene, beta-carotene, and retinol), which were assessed as either absolute blood levels and/or high-throughput metabolite levels, independent genetic instrumental variables were selected from earlier genome-wide association studies (P<5x10-8). We used summary statistics for single-nucleotide polymorphisms-stroke associations from 3 European-ancestry cohorts (cases/controls): MEGASTROKE (60 341/454 450), UK Biobank (2404/368 771), and the FinnGen study (8046/164 286). Mendelian randomization analyses were performed on each exposure per outcome cohort using inverse variance-weighted analyses and subsequently meta-analyzed. In a combined sample of 1 058 298 individuals (70 791 cases), none of the genetically influenced absolute antioxidants or antioxidant metabolite concentrations were causally associated with a lower risk of ischemic stroke. For absolute antioxidants levels, the odds ratios (ORs) ranged between 0.94 (95% CI, 0.85-1.05) for vitamin C and 1.04 (95% CI, 0.99-1.08) for lycopene. For metabolites, ORs ranged between 1.01 (95% CI, 0.98-1.03) for retinol and 1.12 (95% CI, 0.88-1.42) for vitamin E. Conclusions This study did not provide evidence for a causal association between dietary-derived antioxidant levels and ischemic stroke. Therefore, antioxidant supplements to increase circulating levels are unlikely to be of clinical benefit to prevent ischemic stroke.","Authors":"Martens, Leon G.; Luo, Jiao; Willems van Dijk, Ko; Jukema, J.

We performed a multivariate genome-wide association study using body fat percentage and metabolic biomarkers from UK Biobank and identified 38 UFA and 36 FA variants. Adiposity-increasing alleles were associated with an adverse metabolic profile, higher risk of disease, higher CRP, and higher fat in subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue, liver, and pancreas for UFA and a favorable metabolic profile, lower risk of disease, higher CRP and higher subcutaneous adipose tissue but lower liver fat for FA. We detected no sexual dimorphism. The Mendelian randomization studies provided evidence for a risk-increasing effect of UFA and protective effect of FA for type 2 diabetes, heart dis-ease, hypertension, stroke, nonalcoholic fatty liver dis-ease, and polycystic ovary syndrome. FA is distinct from UFA by its association with lower liver fat and protection from cardiometabolic diseases; it was not associated with visceral or pancreatic fat.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs); rs1801133, rs1801131 in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 'MTHFR' gene, rs1805087 in methyl tetrahydrofolate homocysteine methyltransferase 'MTR' gene, and rs662 in paroxanse1 'PON1' gene, rs4646994, angiotensin converting enzyme 'ACE' insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism were resolved employing conventional, and by tetra primer allele refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction (PCR). ANOVA association testing revealed that homocysteine, cholesterol, creatinine, triglyceride levels, age, family history of CAD, and polymorphisms in MTHFR and PON1 related to coronary artery disease. The post HOC analysis also maintained significance differences in the control, ischemic heart disease and case groups respectively. The regression analysis failed to maintain statistical significance for creatinine, triglycerides, age, and rs662 PON1 polymorphism, whereby, serum homocysteine, cholesterol, family history, and rs1801133/rs1801131 MTHFR SNPs maintained statistical significance. The results from the present study provide hint into interlaced nature of traditional and novel risk factors in the causation of arterial disease and an insight into their shared detrimental effects in affecting the coronary vasculature.Copyright © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.","Authors":"Masud, R.; Khan, A.

High serum GDF-15 concentration and the apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A1 ratio (ApoB/ApoA1) are involved in the above-mentioned mechanisms and are thought to be related to the occurrence of adverse cardiovascular events. However, it remains unclear whether circulating GDF-15 levels and the ApoB/ApoA1 ratio are related to T2DM patients with CAD., METHODS: T2DM patients with or without CAD were eligible for this study. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 502 T2DM patients were enrolled between January 2021 and December 2021 and were then divided into T2DM group (n = 249) and CAD group (n = 253). The ApoB, ApoA1 and GDF-15 concentrations were measured at hospital admission and the ApoB/ApoA1 ratio was then calculated., RESULTS: Compared with T2DM group, serum GDF-15 levels and ApoB/ApoA1 ratio increased in CAD group. Furthermore, a positive relationship between the occurrence of CAD in diabetic population and circulating GDF-15 concentrations and ApoB/ApoA1 ratio was observed in logistic regression analysis (p < 0.01). Restrictive cubic spline analysis after adjusted for multiple risky variables showed that serum GDF-15 or ApoB/ApoA1 ratio correlated positively with CAD., CONCLUSIONS: Circulating GDF-15 levels and serum ApoB/ApoA1 ratio vary in CAD group and T2DM group.

However, prior studies that have investigated the role of adhesion pathway proteins in risk of AF have been limited in the number of proteins that were studied and in the ethnic and racial diversity of the study population. Therefore we aimed to study the associations of fifteen adhesion pathway proteins with incident AF in a large, diverse population., METHODS: Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis participants from four races/ethnicities (n = 2504) with protein levels measured were followed for incident AF (n = 253). HGF protein was measured on Exam 1 samples (N = 6669; AF n = 851). Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the association of AF with 15 adhesion pathway proteins. Bonferroni correction was applied to account for multiple comparisons., RESULTS: After adjusting for potential confounding variables (age, sex, race/ethnicity, height, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, antihypertension therapy, diabetes status, current smoker, current alcohol use, and total and HDL cholesterol), and accounting for multiple testing (P < 0.05/15 = 0.0033), circulating levels of the following proteins were positively associated with a higher risk of AF: MMP-2 (HR per standard deviation increment, 1.27; 95% CI 1.11-1.45), TIMP-2 (HR 1.28; 95% CI 1.12-1.46), VCAM-1 (HR 1.32; 95% CI 1.16-1.50), and SLPI (HR 1.22; 95% CI 1.07-1.38).

However, previous research has lacked in operationalizing multiscale risk factors to determine individual and interactive associations over the life course. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate individual and interactive associations of multiscale risk factors for CVD outcomes including genetics and PSFs at middle and older-aged stages of the life course. Method(s): Baseline data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA; n = 9,892 with genome-wide genotyping data) was used for this investigation. A 39 single nucleotide polymorphism polygenic risk score (PRS) for CVD was constructed. PSFs consisted of: (1) Depressive symptoms categorized into: \"none\" (Group 1, reference), \"current\" (Group 2), \"clinical depression with no current symptoms\" (Group 3), and \"potential, recurrent depression\" (Group 4); and (2) Social isolation index as a binary variable comprised of marital status, living arrangements, retirement status, contacts, and social participation. Heart-related disorders (HRD: myocardial infarction, angina and heart disease) was the primary outcome of interest and peripheral/vascular-related disorders (PVRD: stroke, peripheral vascular disease and hypertension) was the secondary outcome. Multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for socio-demographic factors were conducted stratified by age group (middle-aged: 45-69 years, older-aged: >=70 years). Result(s): PRS was associated with HRD among middle- and older-aged participants [OR (95% confidence interval)] [1.06 (1.03-1.08), 1.06 (1.03-1.08), respectively]. Most depressive symptoms groups compared to the reference associated with HRD and PVRD, but only Group 4 associated with PVRD among older-aged [1.69 (1.08-2.64)]. Social isolation was associated with only PVRD among middle-aged [1.84 (1.04-3.26)]; however, socially isolated CLSA participants were underrepresented in the genotyped cohort (1.2%). No significant PRS*PSFs interactions were observed. Conclusion(s): Genetics and PSFs are independently associated with CVD. Varying observations across age groups underscores the need to advance research on multiscale risk factors operating both at a given point in time and over the life course. Future cohort studies may benefit from use of mobile assessment units to enable better reach to socially isolated participants for collection of biospecimens.© Copyright © 2021 Menniti, Paquet, Han, Dube and Nielsen.","Authors":"Menniti, G.; Paquet, C.; Han, H.

We investigated causal effects of HRI, HRR, and resting HR on CV risk, all-cause mortality (ACM), atrial fibrillation (AF), coronary artery disease (CAD), and ischemic stroke (IS) using Mendelian Randomization. Method(s): 11 variants for HRI, 11 for HRR, and two sets of 46 and 414 variants for resting HR were obtained from four genome-wide association studies (GWASs) on UK Biobank. We performed a lookup on GWASs for CV risk and ACM in UK Biobank (N = 375,367, 5.4% cases and N = 393,165, 4.4% cases, respectively). For CAD, AF, and IS, we used publicly available summary statistics. We used a random-effects inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method and sensitivity analyses to estimate causality. Result(s): IVW showed a nominally significant effect of HRI on CV events (odds ratio [OR] = 1.0012, P = 4.11 x 10-2) and on CAD and AF. Regarding HRR, IVW was not significant for any outcome. The IVW method indicated statistically significant associations of resting HR with AF (OR = 0.9825, P = 9.8 x 10-6), supported by all sensitivity analyses, and a nominally significant association with IS (OR = 0.9926, P = 9.82 x 10-3).

Protein C (PC) is an important antithrombotic enzyme which its genetic variations disrupt the normal cascade of blood coagulation, resulting in thrombosis and increases the chance of stroke. Therefore, we aimed to investigate three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the core promoter of PC in order to find their role in this condition in the Iranian population. Blood samples from IS patients (n = 249) and healthy volunteers (n = 203) were collected. Biochemical analysis was performed. Genotyping was conducted on the extracted DNA from blood samples via the HRM technique. Bioinformatic investigations were used to assess how these SNPs may be involved in the IS. Smoking, hypertension, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and fasting blood glucose were significantly different between healthy and IS groups. rs1799809 and rs1799810 SNPs were significantly more frequent among IS patients. Also, among four identified haplotypes, CGT was found associated with IS (p = 0.001). It was also found that these SNPs may interfere with the binding of transcription factors to alter the expression of PC. Our data predict that SNPs at the core promoter of PC can affect the binding affinity of transcription factors which in turn reduces the expression of PC and increases the risk of IS.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.","Authors":"Meshkani, S.

Oxidative stress is crucial in stroke pathogenesis. Many cohort-based studies suggested that the intake of exogenous antioxidants originated from food may prevent stroke. However, the corresponding randomized controlled trials did not show diet-derived antioxidants have a protective effect on stroke. Objectives. To examine the association of genetically proxied diet-derived antioxidants with stroke risk using Mendelian randomization. Methods. We performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to evaluate the causal effect of diet-derived antioxidants on stroke risk. For exposure data, we extracted genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs) that are strongly associated with frequently used diet-derived antioxidants, including vitamin C, vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol, gamma-tocopherol), carotene, retinol, zinc, and selenium, from a large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS). We obtained IVs' corresponding effect estimates on the risk of total stroke and ischemic stroke from a GWAS meta-analysis with 40,585 cases and 406,111 controls. Finally, we applied five types of Mendelian randomization analysis to obtain preliminary MR results and performed four three kinds of sensitivity analysis to verify them. Results. According to the primary MR estimations and further sensitivity analyses, we established two robust associations after Bonferroni correction: genetically proxied circulating gamma-tocopherol was causally associated with total stroke [odds ratio OR=0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.52-0.88), p=3.78E-03] and ischemic stroke [OR=0.66, 95% CI (0.51-0.86), p=2.34E-03]. There was no evidence to support the causal effect of other diet-derived antioxidants on the risk of total stroke and ischemic stroke. Conclusion. Our study revealed a protective impact of genetic susceptibility to high circulating gamma-tocopherol levels on stroke risk, providing new information on the potential therapeutic targets for primary stroke prevention.Copyright © 2022 Rujia Miao et al.","Authors":"Miao, R.; Li, J.; Meng, C.; Li, Y.; Tang, H.; Wang, J.; Deng, P.; Lu, Y.","Publisher":"Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity","Issue":"Not Available","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/6457318","Pages":"6457318","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"MR diet-derived antioxidants"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":3,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":15,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":24,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":42,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":47,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":58,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":2527,"Title":"Elastographic parameters of liver steatosis and fibrosis predict independently the risk of incident chronic kidney disease and acute myocardial infarction in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus","Year":2022,"Country":"","Abstract":"AIMS: The aim of this prospective study was to examine the relationship between controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) and liver stiffness measurements (LSM) with the risk of developing a composite endpoint inclusive of incident acute myocardial infarction (AMI), cerebrovascular insult (CVI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD) in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)., METHODS: This study included 238 T2DM outpatients without chronic liver diseases., RESULTS: The patient population was followed for a median period of 7.6 years. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses showed that there was a higher proportion of patients who developed the aforementioned composite outcome (P < 0.001 by the log-rank test), as well as CKD (P < 0.001) or AMI alone (P = 0.014) among those with elevated CAP values (>=238 dB/m) at baseline.

Whether this association exists for both sexes is, however, uncertain. Hence, we analysed the risk of CVE associated with IL6 trans-signalling in men and women and investigated if potential interaction between IL6 trans-signalling and sex affects the risk., METHODS: In a prospective cohort of 60-year-old men and women without cardiovascular disease (men=2039, women=2193), subjects were followed for 20 years. To assess the IL6 trans-signalling activity, the proportion between the active binary and inactive ternary IL6 complexes, the binary/ternary ratio (B/T ratio), was estimated. CVE (myocardial infarction, angina pectoris and ischaemic stroke, n=629) risk was analysed with Cox regression, presented as HRs with 95% CIs. B/T ratio was dichotomised, with levels >median representing IL6 trans-signalling. Interaction was analysed on the additive scale and expressed as the synergy index (S). Analyses were adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors., RESULTS: B/T ratio >median was associated with increased CVE risk in men (HR 1.63; 95% CI 1.32 to 2.01), but not in women (HR 1.21; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.57). There was a significant synergistic interaction (S=1.98; 95% CI 1.15 to 3.42) between the B/T ratio and male sex, the combination increasing the risk by 88%., CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest differential susceptibility to inflammation mediated by IL6 trans-signalling and subsequent CVE in men and women.

Despite highly heritable etiology, our understanding of the genetic architecture of AF remains incomplete. Here we performed a genome-wide association study in the Japanese population comprising 9,826 cases among 150,272 individuals and identified East Asian-specific rare variants associated with AF. A cross-ancestry meta-analysis of >1 million individuals, including 77,690 cases, identified 35 new susceptibility loci. Transcriptome-wide association analysis identified IL6R as a putative causal gene, suggesting the involvement of immune responses. Integrative analysis with ChIP-seq data and functional assessment using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes demonstrated ERRg as having a key role in the transcriptional regulation of AF-associated genes. A polygenic risk score derived from the cross-ancestry meta-analysis predicted increased risks of cardiovascular and stroke mortalities and segregated individuals with cardioembolic stroke in undiagnosed AF patients. Our results provide new biological and clinical insights into AF genetics and suggest their potential for clinical applications.Copyright © 2023, The Author(s).","Authors":"Miyazawa, K.; Ito, K.; Ito, M.; Zou, Z.; Kubota, M.; Nomura, S.; Matsunaga, H.; Koyama, S.; Ieki, H.; Akiyama, M.; Koike, Y.; Kurosawa, R.; Yoshida, H.; Ozaki, K.; Onouchi, Y.; Takahashi, A.; Matsuda, K.; Murakami, Y.; Aburatani, H.; Kubo, M.; Momozawa, Y.; Terao, C.; Oki, S.; Akazawa, H.; Kamatani, Y.; Komuro, I.","Publisher":"Nature Genetics","Issue":"Not Available","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41588-022-01284-9","Pages":"Not Available","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"polygenic risk score & 35 new genetic loci & IL6R gene & MR & transcription wide association study"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":9,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":20,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":43,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":47,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":54,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":2555,"Title":"9p21 Locus Polymorphism Is A Strong Predictor of Metabolic Syndrome and Cardiometabolic Risk Phenotypes Regardless of Coronary Heart Disease","Year":2022,"Country":"","Abstract":"The world population is genetically predisposed to metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components, also known as cardiometabolic risk phenotypes, which can cause severe health complications including coronary heart disease (CHD). Genetic variants in the 9p21 locus have been associated with CHD in a number of populations including Pakistan. However, the role of the 9p21 locus in MetS and cardiometabolic risk phenotypes (such as obesity, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia) in populations with CHD or no established CHD has not been explored. Therefore, the present study was designed to explore the association of the minor/risk allele (C) of 9p21 locus SNP rs1333049 with MetS or its risk phenotypes regardless of an established CHD, in Pakistani subjects. Genotyping of rs1333049 (G/C) was performed on subjects under a case-control study design; healthy controls and cases, MetS with CHD (MetS-CHD+) and MetS with no CHD (MetS-CHD-), respectively. Genotype and allele frequencies were calculated in all study groups. Anthropometric and clinical variables (Means +/- SD) were compared among study groups (i.e., controls, MetS + CHD and MetS-CHD) and minor/risk C allele carriers (GC + CC) vs. non-carriers (Normal GG genotype). Associations of the risk allele of rs1333049 SNP with disease and individual metabolic risk components were explored using adjusted multivariate logistic regression models (OR at 95% CI) with a threshold p-value of <=0.05. Our results have shown that the minor allele frequency (MAF) was significantly high in the MAF cases (combined = 0.63, MetS-CHD+ = 0.57 and MetS-CHD- = 0.57) compared with controls (MAF = 0.39). The rs1333049 SNP significantly increased the risk of MetS, irrespective of CHD (MetS-CHD+ OR = 2.36, p < 0.05 and MetS-CHD- OR = 4.04, p < 0.05), and cardiometabolic risk phenotypes; general obesity, central obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia (OR = 1.56-3.25, p < 0.05) except hyperglycemia, which lacked any significant association (OR = 0.19, p = 0.29) in the present study group. The 9p21 genetic locus/rs1333049 SNP is strongly associated with, and can be a genetic predictor of, MetS and cardiometabolic risks, irrespective of cardiovascular diseases in the Pakistani population.","Authors":"Mobeen Zafar, Muhammad; Saqlain, Muhammad; Mehmood Raja, Asad; Arzoo Shaiq, Pakeeza; Javaid Asad, Muhammad; Nawaz Shah, Muhammad Kausar; Fatima, Farah; Valadi, Hadi; Nawaz, Muhammad; Raja, Ghazala Kaukab","Publisher":"Genes","Issue":"12","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes13122226","Pages":"Not Available","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"9p21 genetic locus & its variant rs1333049"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":43,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":47,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":58,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":2566,"Title":"Iron hypothesis and coronary artery disease in geriatric patients","Year":2020,"Country":"","Abstract":"Context and aims: Iron is a pro-oxidant factor in the pathogenesis of CAD. The association of body iron status was investigated relative to the occurrence and severity of CAD. Design and methods: The subjects consisted of 110 males and 115 females who were classified as either a CAD case or a control according to the results of coronary angiography. Results: A new parameter, the \"serum free iron index,\" was defined as the ratio of serum iron to UIBC. The level of ferritin showed significant increase [97.2 (67.0-171.2) microg/L vs. 85.6 (52.5-129.4), p = .034], whereas serum total iron, free iron index, transferrin, UIBC and iron saturation were unchanged in CAD patients relative to control group. Among the indices of body iron only serum ferritin had significant association with the likelihood (OR of 1.004 (1.000-1.007), p = .04) and severity of CAD [chi2(3)= 7.99, p = .01], but the correlation was lessened in the presence of classical risk factors. Serum ferritin had also the highest and significant efficiency to predict CAD (AUC = 0.61, p = .020). Conclusions: Serum ferritin as a marker of intracellular iron has significant association with CAD; nevertheless, the correlation is not independent.

The aim of this study was to clarify the causal association between type II diabetes predisposition and AAA using Mendelian randomisation., METHODS: Effect estimates for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with diabetes were obtained from the DIAbetes Meta-ANalysis of Trans-Ethnic association studies (DIAMANTE) consortium to construct a genetic instrumental variable. Corresponding effect estimates for associations of these SNPs with AAA were obtained from the International Aneurysm Consortium comprising six separate AAA genomewide association studies (4 972 cases and 99 858 controls). Mendelian randomisation estimates were calculated using inverse variance, weighted median, and MR-Egger methods, and compared against recently published observational estimates., RESULTS: A genetic risk score was constructed from 206 SNPs associated with diabetes. All three Mendelian randomisation models showed no effect of genetic liability to diabetes and risk of AAA (inverse variance: odds ratio 1.04 per unit higher log odds, 95% 0.98 - 1.11, p = .19; MR-Egger slope p = .33; weighted median p = .50).

A total of 830 patients were studied: 303 patients with ischemic stroke on the background of hypertensive disease and 527 patients with hypertensive disease without stroke. SNP for metalloproteinases were studied using the real-time polymerase chain reaction. The functional significance and influences of polymorphic loci on gene expression were studied using the HaploReg (v4.1) (http://archive.broadinstitute.org) and GTEx-portal (http://gtexportal.org) services.

An association was found between the GG rs11568818 genotype of the MMP7 gene and a high risk of developing stroke in patients experiencing regular stress (odds ratio (OR) 1.71). The 5A allele and the 5A/5A genotype of rs3025058 of the MMP3 gene had protective effects on development of stroke in people without histories of chronic stress (OR 0.73 and OR 0.60, respectively).

The performance of the polygenic risk score was compared with that of the 2013 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association pooled cohort equations., Exposures: Genetic risk was computed for each participant by summing the product of the weights and allele dosage across 6630149 SNPs. Weights were based on an international genome-wide association study., Main Outcomes and Measures: Prediction of 10-year first CHD events (including myocardial infarctions, fatal coronary events, silent infarctions, revascularization procedures, or resuscitated cardiac arrest) assessed using measures of model discrimination, calibration, and net reclassification improvement (NRI)., Results: The study population included 4847 adults from the ARIC study (mean [SD] age, 62.9 [5.6] years; 56.4% women) and 2390 adults from the MESA cohort (mean [SD] age, 61.8 [9.6] years; 52.2% women). Incident CHD events occurred in 696 participants (14.4%) and 227 participants (9.5%), respectively, over median follow-up of 15.5 years (interquartile range [IQR], 6.3 years) and 14.2 (IQR, 2.5 years) years. The polygenic risk score was significantly associated with 10-year CHD incidence in ARIC with hazard ratios per SD increment of 1.24 (95% CI, 1.15 to 1.34) and in MESA, 1.38 (95% CI, 1.21 to 1.58). Addition of the polygenic risk score to the pooled cohort equations did not significantly increase the C statistic in either cohort (ARIC, change in C statistic, -0.001; 95% CI, -0.009 to 0.006; MESA, 0.021; 95% CI, -0.0004 to 0.043). At the 10-year risk threshold of 7.5%, the addition of the polygenic risk score to the pooled cohort equations did not provide significant improvement in reclassification in either ARIC (NRI, 0.018, 95% CI, -0.012 to 0.036) or MESA (NRI, 0.001, 95% CI, -0.038 to 0.076). The polygenic risk score did not significantly improve calibration in either cohort., Conclusions and Relevance: In this analysis of 2 cohorts of US adults, the polygenic risk score was associated with incident coronary heart disease events but did not significantly improve discrimination, calibration, or risk reclassification compared with conventional predictors. These findings suggest that a polygenic risk score may not enhance risk prediction in a general, white middle-aged population.","Authors":"Mosley, Jonathan D.; Gupta, Deepak K.; Tan, Jingyi; Yao, Jie; Wells, Quinn S.; Shaffer, Christian M.; Kundu, Suman; Robinson-Cohen, Cassianne; Psaty, Bruce M.; Rich, Stephen S.; Post, Wendy S.; Guo, Xiuqing; Rotter, Jerome I.; Roden, Dan M.; Gerszten, Robert E.; Wang, Thomas J.","Publisher":"JAMA","Issue":"7","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.2019.21782","Pages":"627-635","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"polygenic risk score"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":3,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":24,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":37,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":40,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":47,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":49,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":2624,"Title":"Calcified carotid artery atheroma and stroke risk assessment.

However, there has not been agreement on the relationship between CCAA and risk for stroke or other CVA. Method and materials: The question asked was, \"Are patients with CCAA detected on panoramic radiographs more likely to get a stroke or CVA in the future compared to those who do not have CCAA and, further, would Doppler ultrasonography of the neck obtained secondary to panoramic radiography in suspected individuals add value to this association with stroke or CVA?\" This meta-analysis was conducted by searching PubMed, Ovid Medline, Dentistry & Oral Sciences Source, CINAHL, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Six studies that met the inclusion criteria were included in the final analysis; three used panoramic radiography and the rest used panoramic radiography and ultrasonography. Multiple random effect meta-analyses were conducted using RevMan 5.2 software. Conclusion: Evidence from this meta-analysis shows that although detection of CCAA via panoramic radiography to predict risk for stroke may be comparable to Doppler ultrasonography, risk prediction is somewhat more significant when diagnostic confirmation is made using Doppler ultrasonography than panoramic radiography alone. Clinical implications: Because stroke risk assessment is complicated and comprises many additional systemic factors beyond calcification of the carotid artery, CVA prediction is more reliable when Doppler ultrasonography is used after panoramic radiography. Managing hypertension, diabetes, and smoking habit are far more important in risk management of patients with CCAA detection on panoramic radiography.","Authors":"Mupparapu, Mel; Nath, Sapna","Publisher":"Quintessence international (Berlin, Germany : 1985)","Issue":"0","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3290/j.qi.a45604","Pages":"348-359","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"calcified carotid artery atheroma (CCAA) measured by doppler ultrasonography"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":3,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":18,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":24,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":41,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":47,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":55,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":2637,"Title":"Diffusion-Weighted Imaging Lesions after Intracerebral Hemorrhage and Risk of Stroke: A MISTIE III and ATACH-2 Analysis","Year":2021,"Country":"","Abstract":"Background and Purpose: Punctate ischemic lesions noted on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) are associated with poor functional outcomes after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Whether these lesions increase long-term risk of stroke is poorly understood. Method(s): We pooled individual patient data from the ATACH-2 trial (Antihypertensive Treatment of Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage) and the MISTIE III trial (Minimally Invasive Surgery Plus Alteplase for Intracerebral Hemorrhage Evacuation Phase 3). We included subjects with a magnetic resonance imaging scan. The exposure was a DWI lesion. The primary outcome was any stroke, defined as a composite of ischemic stroke or recurrent ICH, whereas secondary outcomes were incident ischemic stroke and recurrent ICH. Using multivariate Cox regression analysis, we evaluated the risk of stroke. Result(s): Of 505 patients with ICH with magnetic resonance imaging, 466 were included. DWI lesions were noted in 214 (45.9%) subjects, and 34 incident strokes (20 ischemic stroke and 14 recurrent ICH) were observed during a median follow-up of 324 days (interquartile range, 91-374). Presence of a DWI lesion was associated with a 6.9% (95% CI, 2.2-11.6) absolute increase in risk of all stroke (hazard ratio, 2.6 [95% CI, 1.2-5.7]). Covariate adjustment with Cox regression models also demonstrated this increased risk. In the secondary analyses, there was an increased risk of ischemic stroke (hazard ratio, 3.5 [95% CI, 1.1-11.0]) but not recurrent ICH (hazard ratio, 1.7 [95% CI, 0.6-5.1]). Conclusion(s): In a heterogeneous cohort of patients with ICH, presence of a DWI lesion was associated with a 2.5-fold heightened risk of stroke among ICH survivors.

Method(s): From a prospective population-based cohort of Japanese American men from the Kuakini Honolulu Heart Program (KHHP), age-adjusted prevalence of ICH by hypertension was assessed for the whole cohort after stratifying by FOXO3 genotype. Cox regression models, adjusted for age, cardiovascular risk factors and, FOXO3 and APOE genotypes, were utilized to determine relative risk of hypertension's effect on ICH. All models were created for the whole cohort and stratified by FOXO3 G-allele carriage vs. TT genotype. Result(s): Among 6469 men free of baseline stroke, FOXO3 G-allele carriage was seen in 3009 (46.5%) participants. Overall, 183 participants developed ICH over the 34-year follow-up period. Age-adjusted ICH incidence was 0.90 vs. 1.32 per 1000 person-years follow-up in those without and with hypertension, respectively (P1/40.002). After stratifying by FOXO3 genotype, this association was no longer significant in G allele carriers. In the whole cohort, hypertension was an independent predictor of ICH (relative risk [RR]1/41.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.25, 2.32; P1/40.0007). In stratified analyses, hypertension remained an independent predictor of ICH among the FOXO3 TT-genotype group (RR1/42.02, 95% CI 1.33, 3.07; P1/40.001), but not in FOXO3 G-allele carriers (RR1/41.39, 95% CI 0.88, 2.19; P1/40.15).

Although multiple diseases will usually afflict patients at once or in succession, conventional PRSs fail to consider genetic relationships across multiple diseases. Even multi-trait PRSs, which take into account genetic effects for more than one disease at a time, fail to consider a sufficient number of phenotypes to accurately reflect the state of disease comorbidity in a patient, or are biased in terms of the traits that are selected. Thus, we developed novel network-based comorbidity risk scores to quantify associations among multiple phenotypes from phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS). We first constructed a disease-SNP heterogeneous multi-layered network (DS-Net), which consists of a disease network (disease-layer) and SNP network (SNP-layer). The disease-layer describes the population-level interactome from PheWAS data. The SNP-layer was constructed according to linkage disequilibrium. Both layers were attached to transform the information from a population-level interactome to individual-level inferences. Then, graph-based semi-supervised learning was applied to predict possible comorbidity scores on disease-layer for each subject. The SNP-layer serves as receiving individual genotyping data in the scoring process, and the disease-layer serves as the propagated output for an individual's multiple disease comorbidity scores. The possible comorbidity scores were combined by logistic regression, and it is denoted as netCRS. The DS-Net was constructed from UK Biobank PheWAS data, and the individual genetic profiles were collected from the Penn Medicine Biobank. As a proof-of-concept study, myocardial infarction (MI) was selected to compare netCRS with the PRS with pruning and thresholding (PRS-PT). The combined model (netCRS + PRS-PT + covariates) achieved an AUC improvement of 6.26% compared to the (PRS-PT + covariates) model. In terms of risk stratification, the combined model was able to capture the risk of MI up to approximately eight-fold higher than that of the low-risk group. The netCRS and PRS-PT complement each other in predicting high-risk groups of patients with MI. We expect that using these risk prediction models will allow for the development of prevention strategies and reduction of MI morbidity and mortality.","Authors":"Nam, Yonghyun; Jung, Sang-Hyuk; Verma, Anurag; Sriram, Vivek; Won, Hong-Hee; Yun, Jae-Seung; Kim, Dokyoon","Publisher":"Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing.

APS is an autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of thrombosis and antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), which provide a pro-coagulant state. The aPL included in the classification criteria are lupus anticoagulant, anti-cardiolipin (aCL) and anti-beta2-glycoprotein-I antibodies (aB2GPI) of IgG and IgM isotypes. Extra-criteria aPL, especially IgA aB2GPI and IgG/IgM anti-phosphatidylserine/prothrombin antibodies (aPS/PT), have been strongly associated with thrombosis. However, their role in the general population suffering from stroke is unknown. We aim (1) to evaluate the aPL prevalence in ischemic stroke patients, (2) to determine the role of aPL as a risk factor for stroke, and (3) to create an easy-to-use tool to stratify the risk of ischemic stroke occurrence considering the presence of aPL and other risk factors. Material(s) and Method(s): A cohort of 245 consecutive ischemic stroke patients was evaluated in the first 24 h after the acute event for the presence of classic aPL, extra-criteria aPL (IgA aB2GPI, IgG, and IgM aPS/PT) and conventional cardiovascular risk factors. These patients were followed-up for 2-years. A group of 121 healthy volunteers of the same age range and representative of the general population was used as reference population. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee for Clinical Research (Reference numbers CEIC-14/354 and CEIC-18/182). Result(s): The overall aPL prevalence in stroke patients was 28% and IgA aB2GPI were the most prevalent (20%). In the multivariant analysis, the presence of IgA aB2GPI (OR 2.40, 95% CI: 1.03-5.53), dyslipidemia (OR 1.70, 95% CI: 1.01-2.84), arterial hypertension (OR 1.82, 95% CI: 1.03-3.22), atrial fibrillation (OR 4.31, 95% CI: 1.90-9.78), and active smoking (OR 3.47, 95% CI: 1.72-6.99) were identified as independent risk factors for ischemic stroke. A risk stratification tool for stroke was created based on these factors (AUC: 0.75). Conclusion(s): IgA aB2GPI are an important independent risk factor for ischemic stroke. Evaluation of aPL (including extra-criteria) in cardiovascular risk factor assessment for stroke can potentially increase the identification of patients at risk of thrombotic event, facilitating a decision on preventive treatments.Copyright © 2021 Naranjo, Ostos, Gil-Etayo, Hernandez-Gallego, Cabrera-Marante, Pleguezuelo, Diaz-Simon, Cerro, Lora, Martinez-Salio and Serrano.","Authors":"Naranjo, L.; Ostos, F.; Gil-Etayo, F.

We assessed whether plasma ACE2 concentrations were associated with greater risk of death or cardiovascular disease events. Method(s): We used data from the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) prospective study to conduct a case-cohort analysis within a subset of PURE participants (from 14 countries across five continents: Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, and South America). We measured plasma concentrations of ACE2 and assessed potential determinants of plasma ACE2 levels as well as the association of ACE2 with cardiovascular events. Finding(s): We included 10 753 PURE participants in our study. Increased concentration of plasma ACE2 was associated with increased risk of total deaths (hazard ratio [HR] 1.35 per 1 SD increase [95% CI 1.29-1.43]) with similar increases in cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular deaths. Plasma ACE2 concentration was also associated with higher risk of incident heart failure (HR 1.27 per 1 SD increase [1.10-1.46]), myocardial infarction (HR 1.23 per 1 SD increase [1.13-1.33]), stroke (HR 1.21 per 1 SD increase [1.10-1.32]) and diabetes (HR 1.44 per 1 SD increase [1.36-1.52]). These findings were independent of age, sex, ancestry, and traditional cardiac risk factors. With the exception of incident heart failure events, the independent relationship of ACE2 with the clinical endpoints, including death, remained robust after adjustment for BNP. The highest-ranked determinants of ACE2 concentrations were sex, geographic ancestry, and body-mass index (BMI). When compared with clinical risk factors (smoking, diabetes, blood pressure, lipids, and BMI), ACE2 was the highest ranked predictor of death, and superseded several risk factors as a predictor of heart failure, stroke, and myocardial infarction. Interpretation(s): Increased plasma ACE2 concentration was associated with increased risk of major cardiovascular events in a global study.

Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) is responsible for blood pressure regulation and vascular homeostasis. Our objective was to conduct a comprehensive meta-analysis for ascertaining the association of ACE I/D polymorphism with HS since a number of studies depicted inconclusive evidence. Method(s): Literature search was performed till July 10, 2020 in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, Chinese National Knowledge Information and Google Scholar databases with keywords: ('Angiotensin Converting Enzyme' OR 'ACE') AND ('Single Nucleotide polymorphisms' OR 'SNP') AND ('Hemorrhagic stroke or 'HS'). Pooled Odds Ratio (OR) and 95% Confidence Interval (CI) were determined for gene-disease association using either fixed (when I2 < 50%) or random effect (when I2 > 50%) models. Risk of bias in studies was assessed using funnel plots and sensitivity analyses. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA version 13.0 software. Result(s): A total of 53 studies having 5186 HS and 7347 healthy control subjects were included in our meta-analysis. Pooled analyses showed that ACE I/D gene polymorphism had significant association with risk of HS in overall study population [(dominant model: OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.12-1.50 & recessive model: OR = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.46-2.20)].

Design and methods: This observational cross-sectional study included 112 patients with T1DM from a larger cohort (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02910271), selected (1:2) as per the presence of aPAD (n = 37) or not (n = 75). aPAD was evaluated by ankle-brachial index (ABI), toe-brachial index (TBI), and peripheral Doppler ultrasound. The two groups of patients were matched by age, gender distribution and duration of T1DM. Fasting serum copeptin was measured by high-sensitivity ELISA, and its relationships with clinical and biochemical variables as well as aPAD were evaluated too. Result(s): The study population was aged 42 +/- 8 years, duration of T1DM was 27 +/- 7 years, and mean HbA1c was 7.7 +/- 1.1%. No significant differences in copeptin concentrations were found between patients with or without aPAD (16.9 +/- 10.8 vs 17.3 +/- 14.7 pmol/L, respectively; P = 0.462). Considering all patients as a whole, copeptin correlated with systolic blood pressure (SBP; rho = -0.209, P = 0.027), eGFR rho = -0.271, P = 0.004), and serum sodium (rho = -0.208, P = 0.027), but not with ABI (rho = -0.068, P = 0.476). Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis (R2: 0.059; P = 0.035) retained SBP (beta: -0.219, 95% CI: -1.391; -0.089) as the only significant predictor of copeptin concentration. Conclusion(s): As serum copeptin does not appear to be associated with aPAD in patients with T1DM, further studies are now needed to elucidate whether it has any other potential role to play in the subclinical vascular disease of this patient population.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS","Authors":"Nattero-Chavez, L.; Martinez-Garcia, M.

However, the effect of glucagon on cardiovascular disease has not been widely studied. It has been suggested that insulin may increase the risk of ischemic heart disease. Objective(s): To investigate whether glucagon, the main counteracting hormone of insulin, plays a role in development of ischemic heart disease. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): In this 2-sample Mendelian randomization study, we estimated the causal effect of glucagon on ischemic heart disease and its risk factors using the inverse-variance weighted method with multiplicative random effects and multiple sensitivity analyses. Genetic associations with glucagon and ischemic heart disease and its risk factors, including type 2 diabetes and fasting insulin, were obtained from publicly available genome-wide association studies. Main Outcome Measure(s): Odds ratio for ischemic heart disease and its risk factors per 1 standard deviation change in genetically predicted glucagon. Result(s): Twenty-four single-nucleotide polymorphisms strongly (P < 5 x 10-6) and independently (r2 < 0.05) predicting glucagon were obtained. Genetically predicted higher glucagon was associated with an increased risk of ischemic heart disease (inverse-variance weighted odds ratio, 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.0003-1.05) but not with type 2 diabetes (inverse-variance weighted odds ratio, 0.998, 95% confidence interval, 0.97-1.03), log-transformed fasting insulin (inverse-variance weighted beta, 0.002, 95% confidence interval, -0.01 to 0.01), other glycemic traits, blood pressure, reticulocyte, or lipids. Conclusion(s): Glucagon might have an adverse impact on ischemic heart disease.

Among the identified risk factors, CAD showed highest genetic relatedness with thrombotic conditions. The most represented category was life style features (29%) with evidence of strong genetic overlap with CNS traits. Genetic variants associated with higher cognition were associated with life style characteristics and cardiometabolic features that lower the risk of CAD. Conditional analysis indicated this trend is in part attributed to higher age of first sexual intercourse (AFS) in those with higher cognition. Lower AFS was concordantly associated with higher risk of CAD in males, females, and the combined sample; furthermore, lower AFS was causally associated with several CAD-risk factors including, higher fasting insulin, fasting glucose, LDL, immature reticulocyte fraction, HbA1c levels, as well as, higher risk of T2D and pulmonary embolism but lower levels of HDL.

Here, we present the application of nontargeted metabolic profiling based on liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to identify metabolites that would potentially reflect the adherence to HND and their relationship with the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD)., METHODS: From a Finnish population-based prospective cohort (Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study; KIHD), we collected 364 baseline serum samples in 4 groups: 1) 94 participants with high adherence to HND who developed CAD during the follow-up of 20.4 +/- 7.6 years (cases), 2) 88 participants with high adherence who did not develop CAD during follow-up (controls), 3) 93 CAD cases with low adherence, and 4) 89 controls with low adherence., RESULTS: Indolepropionic acid, proline betaine, vitamin E derivatives, and medium-chain acylcarnitines were associated with adherence to HND after adjustments for age, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), physical activity, and total cholesterol. These metabolites also correlated negatively with blood lipid profiles, BMI, insulin, inflammation marker high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP), smoking, and alcohol consumption, as well as positively with physical activity. Predictors of CAD risk included several lipid molecules, which also indicated lower adherence to HND. But, only the associations with the plasmalogens PC(O-16:0/18:2) and PC(O-16:1/18:2) remained significant after adjusting for age, smoking, systolic blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, and WHR. These plasmalogens did not correlate with any investigated risk factors of CAD at baseline, which may highlight their potential as novel predictors of CAD risk. Interestingly, the metabolic profile predicting CAD risk differed based on the adherence to HND. Also, HND adherence was more distinct within CAD cases than controls, which may emphasize the interaction between HND adherence and CAD risk., CONCLUSIONS: The association between higher adherence to HND and a lower risk of CAD likely involves a complex interaction of various endogenous, plant-, and microbial-derived metabolites.

The aortic size index (ASI) is defined as the AD divided by BSA. The primary aim of this study was to investigate if ASI is a predictor of development AAA, and to compare the predictive impact of ASI to that of the absolute AD. Design. Population-based prospective study including 4161 individuals (53.2% women) from the Tromso study with two valid ultrasound measurements of the AD and no AAA at baseline (Tromso 4, 1994). The primary outcome was AAA (AD >=30 mm) in Tromso 5 (2001). A secondary outcome was aortic growth of >5 mm over 7 years. Estimates of relative risk were calculated in logistic regression models. The main exposure variable was ASI. Adjustments were made for age, gender, smoking, body mass index, total and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and hypertension. Results. In total, 124 incident AAAs (20% among women) were detected. In adjusted analyses, both ASI and AD were strong predictors of AAA, with similar results for men and women. Both ASI and AD were also significant predictors of aortic growth >5 mm. In comparison, AD was superior to ASI as a predictor of both endpoints. Conclusions. ASI was a significant predictor of both AAA development and aortic growth of >5 mm for both men and women, but not a better predictor of either outcomes compared to the AD. The role of ASI compared to the AD as a predictor of AAA development seems to be limited.","Authors":"Nyronning, Linn Aldstedt; Skoog, Per; Videm, Vibeke; Mattsson, Erney","Publisher":"Scandinavian cardiovascular journal : SCJ","Issue":"2","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14017431.2019.1707864","Pages":"130-137","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"aortic size index (ASI)"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":26,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":43,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":47,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":54,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":2784,"Title":"Predicting atrial fibrillation using a combination of genetic risk score and clinical risk factors","Year":2020,"Country":"","Abstract":"Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) has a genetic basis, and environmental factors can modify its actual pathogenesis. Objective(s): The purpose of this study was to construct a combined risk assessment method including both genetic and clinical factors in the Japanese population. Method(s): We screened a cohort of 540 AF patients and 520 non-AF controls for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously associated with AF by genome-wide association studies. The most strongly associated SNPs after propensity score analysis were then used to calculate a weighted genetic risk score (WGRS). We also enrolled 1018 non-AF Japanese subjects as a validation cohort and monitored AF emergence over several years. Finally, we constructed a logistic model for AF prediction combining WGRS and clinical risk factors. Result(s): We identified 5 SNPs (in PRRX1, ZFHX3, PITX2, HAND2, and NEURL1) associated with AF after Bonferroni correction. There was a 4.92-fold difference in AF risk between the highest and lowest WGRS calculated using these 5 SNPs (P = 2.32 x 10-10). Receiver operating characteristic analysis of WGRS yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.73 for the screening cohort and 0.72 for the validation cohort. The predictive logistic model constructed using a combination of WGRS and AF clinical risk factors (age, body mass index, sex, and hypertension) demonstrated better discrimination of AF than WGRS alone (AUC = 0.84; sensitivity 75.4%; specificity 80.2%). Conclusion(s): This novel predictive model of combined AF-associated SNPs and known clinical risk factors can accurately stratify AF risk in the Japanese population.Copyright © 2020 Heart Rhythm Society","Authors":"Okubo, Y.; Nakano, Y.; Ochi, H.; Onohara, Y.; Tokuyama, T.; Motoda, C.; Amioka, M.; Hironobe, N.; Okamura, S.; Ikeuchi, Y.; Miyauchi, S.; Chayama, K.; Kihara, Y.","Publisher":"Heart Rhythm","Issue":"5","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hrthm.2020.01.006","Pages":"699-705","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"genetic risk score & 5 key SNPs (PRRX1 rs3903239 & ZFHX3 rs2106261 & PITX2 rs6817105 & HAND2 rs7698692 & NEURL1 rs6057225)  & clinical risk factors"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":3,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":18,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":42,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":47,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":49,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":55,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":2791,"Title":"Increased Incidence of Ischemic Cerebrovascular Events in Cardiovascular Patients With Elevated Apolipoprotein CIII","Year":2020,"Country":"","Abstract":"Background and Purpose - Apo CIII (apolipoprotein CIII), a crucial regulator of lipoprotein metabolism, has been associated with increased activity of coagulation factors and thrombin generation and, in turn, with an increased risk of thromboembolic events in both arterial and venous districts. Thus, we hypothesized that it may affect the risk of acute ischemic cerebrovascular events in cardiovascular patients. Methods- We systematically checked medical records and quantified cerebral ischemic events in a cohort of 950 subjects (median age 65 with interquartile range, 55-79 years; 30.7% females) with or without angiographically defined coronary artery disease (CAD: 774 CAD and 176 CAD-free, respectively). All the subjects, enrolled between May 1999 and December 2006, were prospectively followed until death or July 31, 2018. Assessments of complete plasma lipid and apolipoprotein profiles, including Apo A-I, B, CIII, and E, were available for all subjects at enrollment. Results - After a median follow-up of 130 months (interquartile range, 69-189), 95 subjects (10%) suffered ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) events. Stroke/TIA subjects had higher Apo CIII plasma concentration (11.4; interquartile range: 9.3-14.4 mg/dL) at enrollment than those without stroke/TIA (10.4, interquartile range: 8.7-13.0 mg/dL). Subjects with Apo CIII levels above the median value (10.6 mg/dL) exhibited an =2-fold increased risk of stroke/TIA, even after adjustment for potential confounders, including sex, age, CAD diagnosis, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, oral anticoagulant treatment, and all plasma lipid parameters (hazard ratio: 2.23 [95% CI, 1.21-4.13]). This result was confirmed in CAD and CAD-free populations, separately, and even by a propensity score matching method, in which 98 CAD and 98 CAD-free subjects were one-to-one matched for all clinical and laboratory characteristics. Conclusions - These findings suggest that a high Apo CIII plasma concentration may predict an increased risk of ischemic stroke/TIA in cardiovascular patients.","Authors":"Olivieri, Oliviero; Cappellari, Manuel; Turcato, Gianni; Bonetti, Bruno; Girelli, Domenico; Pizzolo, Francesca; Friso, Simonetta; Bassi, Antonella; Castagna, Annalisa; Martinelli, Nicola","Publisher":"Stroke","Issue":"1","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1161/STROKEAHA.119.026811","Pages":"61-68","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"apolipoprotein CIII (Apo CIII)"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":24,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":42,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":47,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":58,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":2794,"Title":"Global longitudinal strain predicts atrial fibrillation in individuals without hypertension: A Community-based cohort study","Year":2021,"Country":"","Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Global longitudinal strain (GLS) is a sensitive marker of myocardial dysfunction and atrial reservoir function.

Previous studies have indicated strong genetic associations between T2DM and CAD. The objective of this study was to replicate previously reported significant genetic associations for T2DM and CAD which were in a genome-wide significance level in a cohort from the Arab population of the UAE, and to investigate the associations of these loci with twelve cardiometabolic traits that may influence the development of T2DM and CAD., METHODS: A total of nine hundreds and fourteen Emiratis were recruited to this study to investigate associations of 101 loci for T2DM (422 patients and 455 controls), and 53 loci for CAD (160 patients and 245 controls), using logistic regression models which incorporating possible confounding factors. Results are presented using odds ratios with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals and p-values. Linear regression models, which included possible covariates were applied to determine any associations between the T2DM and CAD reported loci with the twelve cardiometabolic traits and results were presented as effect sizes (beta), standard errors, and p-values. Furthermore, the overall risks for all the loci found to be associated with T2DM and CAD were determined using the cumulative effects of the risk alleles. For those found to be associated with the twelve cardiometabolic traits, risks were determined using calculations of their polygenic risk scores., RESULTS: The mean age of the T2DM group was 61.5 +/- 11.3 and of the CAD group was 66.2 +/- 9.3 years. The prevalence of most of the cardiovascular disease risk factors in this cohort were high: mean body mass index (BMI) = 29.4, T2DM (51.9%), hypertension (60.9%), dyslipidemia (68.8%), and smoking (47.9%). All individuals who were tested for CAD (n = 405) also had a diagnosis of T2DM. The highest association variant for T2DM was in SNP rs1977833 in HHEX (p = 0.0016, OR = 0.56 for allele A), which is a multi-ethnic locus for T2DM. The strongest association with CAD was detected with SNP rs264 in LPL, which encodes lipoprotein lipase (p = 0.009, OR = 1.96 for allele A). For the cardiometabolic traits analyses, most notable associations were those of FTO with BMI and waist circumference; ABO with height; KCNK16 with diastolic blood pressure; PROX1-AS1, GCKR, and MIR129-LEP with fasting blood glucose; random blood glucose with ZEB2 and THADA; HbA1c levels with TLE1 and FAM99B loci; HDL-cholesterol levels with BRAF; and triglyceride levels with ZEB2. Furthermore, accumulation of risk alleles and polygenic scores of the associated loci was clearly associated with increased risks for all tested diseases and traits in this cohort., CONCLUSIONS: The present study highlighted many known genetic loci, which are linked to T2DM and CAD and their associations with major cardiometabolic traits in Arab descendants. We confirmed that some loci are associated with T2DM, CAD, and metabolic traits independently of the ethnic background, with a novel association also detected between height and ABO.

We used Rare Exome Variant Ensemble Learner (REVEL) to annotate rare missense variants, clustered predicted deleterious and loss-of-function variants into a \"gene burden\" (N = 72 individuals), and performed a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS). Major findings were replicated in DiscovEHR., RESULTS: The LMNA gene burden was significantly associated with primary cardiomyopathy (p = 1.78E-11) and cardiac conduction disorders (p = 5.27E-07). Most patients had not been clinically diagnosed with LMNA cardiomyopathy. We also noted an association with chronic kidney disease (p = 1.13E-06).

However, a previous Mendelian randomization (MR) study under the linearity assumption reported null causal effects from eGFR on myocardial infarction (MI) risks. Further investigation of the nonlinear causal effect of kidney function assessed by eGFR on the risk of MI by nonlinear MR analysis is warranted. Method(s): In this MR study, genetic instruments for log-eGFR based on serum creatinine were developed from European samples included in the CKDGen genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis (N=567,460). Alternate instruments for log-eGFR based on cystatin C were developed from a GWAS of European individuals that included the CKDGen and UK Biobank data (N=460,826). Nonlinear MR analysis for the risk of MI was performed using the fractional polynomial method and the piecewise linear method on data from individuals of white British ancestry in the UK Biobank (N=321,024, with 12,205 MI cases). Result(s): Nonlinear MR analysis demonstrated a U-shaped (quadratic P value < 0.001) association between MI risk and genetically predicted eGFR (creatinine) values, as MI risk increased as eGFR declined in the low eGFR range and the risk increased as eGFR increased in the high eGFR range. The results were similar even after adjustment for clinical covariates, such as blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, or urine microalbumin levels, or when genetically predicted eGFR (cystatin C) was included as the exposure. Conclusion(s): Genetically predicted eGFR is significantly associated with the risk of MI with a parabolic shape, suggesting that kidney function impairment, either by reduced or supranormal eGFR, may be causally linked to a higher MI risk.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s).","Authors":"Park, S.; Lee, S.; Kim, Y.; Cho, S.; Huh, H.; Kim, K.; Kim, Y.

In the last decade, an association between Alpha-1-Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD) and Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAA) has been hypothesized. Multiple factors may be involved in AAA's etiopathogenesis, and an underlying structural defect of the extracellular matrix (ECM) is always present. AATD could be a reasonable risk factor for AAA because it is related to protease/antiprotease imbalance and enhanced ECM degradation of the vessel wall. Method(s): We performed genotyping of 138 patients hospitalized in the Vascular Surgery Division of the ASST-Spedali Civili di Brescia, Italy, for nontraumatic rupture of AAA. The second purpose was to observe the distribution of main nongenetic risk factors for AAA between patients with and without AATD. Result(s): Out of 138 patients, 22 were found with AATD: 16 MS, 1 SS, 3 MZ, and 2 with a new rare AAT variant. When compared to the general Italian population, our cohort's frequency of deficient S allele was significantly higher (7.8 vs. 2.2% respectively, P < 0.01), whereas the deficient Z allele was similar (1.1 vs. 1.3% respectively, P > 0.05). Although we found no differences in age, gender, hypertension, diabetes, and smoke habits between AAA patients with and without AATD, hyperlipidemia was significantly less frequent in patients with AATD (46.4 vs. 12.5% respectively, P < 0.05). Conclusion(s): In our AAA patients' cohort, the S allele frequency was higher than in the general Italian population. Our results support the hypothesis that AATD might be a risk factor for AAA.Copyright © 2021","Authors":"Pini, L.; Peroni, M.; Zanotti, C.; Pini, A.; Bossoni, E.; Giordani, J.; Bargagli, E.; Perger, E.; Ferrarotti, I.; Vizzardi, E.; Tiberio, L.; Bonardelli, S.; Tantucci, C.","Publisher":"Annals of Vascular Surgery","Issue":"Not Available","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.avsg.2021.05.064","Pages":"195-201","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"Alpha-1-Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD) associated variants"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":3,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":25,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":42,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":47,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":49,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":2989,"Title":"The combined association of depressive symptoms and C-reactive protein for incident disease risk up to 12 years later.

We investigated whether the combination of elevated depressive symptoms and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) was associated with the rate of onset of a range of LTCs., METHODS: We analysed data from 5360 participants (65.77 +/- 9.46 years; 54.1% female) from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). Depressive symptoms were indicated using the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) scale and scores were combined with high sensitivity (hs)-CRP values to reflect the additive interaction between low/high depressive symptoms (CES-D >=4) and low/high CRP (>3mg/L). Participants were followed-up for up to 12 years to predict incident illness. Cox proportional hazard regression was used controlling for covariates., RESULTS: In fully adjusted models, the combination of elevated depressive symptoms and elevated CRP was an independent predictor of coronary heart disease (CHD) (HR = 1.68, 95% C.I. = 1.01-2.78), stroke (HR = 2.02; 95% C.I. = 1.48-2.76), diabetes/high blood glucose (HR = 1.69; 95% C.I. = 1.11-2.57), and pulmonary disease (HR = 1.79; 95% C.I. = 1.02-3.15) relative to low depressive symptoms/low CRP, independently of age, sex, wealth, cohabitation, smoking status, body mass index and hypertension. Elevated depressive symptoms and low CRP was associated with arthritis incidence (HR = 1.49; 95% C.I. = 1.15-1.92). No association was found for cancer incidence., CONCLUSION: A combination of depressive symptoms and CRP was implicated in the onset of CHD, stroke, diabetes/high blood glucose, and pulmonary disease up to 12 years later, reflecting the role of psychobiological processes across multiple disease states.

Method(s): We identified participants from the UK Biobank who experienced incident AF, HF, MI, or stroke during the continuous longitudinal follow-up. The CMR indices and the vascular risk factors (VRFs) as well as the CMR images were obtained for each participant. Three-segmented regions of interest (ROIs) were computed: right ventricle cavity, left ventricle (LV) cavity, and LV myocardium in end-systole and end-diastole phases. Radiomics features were extracted from the 3D volumes of the ROIs. Seven integrative models were built for each incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) as an outcome. Each model was built with VRF, CMR indices, and radiomics features and a combination of them. Support vector machine was used for classification. To assess the model performance, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC were reported. Result(s): AF prediction model using the VRF+CMR+Rad model (accuracy: 0.71, AUC 0.76) obtained the best result. However, the AUC was similar to the VRF+Rad model. HF showed the most significant improvement with the inclusion of CMR metrics (VRF+CMR+Rad: 0.79, AUC 0.84). Moreover, adding only the radiomics features to the VRF reached an almost similarly good performance (VRF+Rad: accuracy 0.77, AUC 0.83). Prediction models looking into incident MI and stroke reached slightly smaller improvement. Conclusion(s): Radiomics features may provide incremental predictive value over VRF and CMR indices in the prediction of incident CVDs. Key Points: * Prediction of incident atrial fibrillation, heart failure, stroke, and myocardial infarction using machine learning techniques. * CMR radiomics, vascular risk factors, and standard CMR indices will be considered in the machine learning models. * The experiments show that radiomics features can provide incremental predictive value over VRF and CMR indices in the prediction of incident cardiovascular diseases.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s).","Authors":"Pujadas, E.

However, evidence for this association is inconsistent, and it remains uncertain whether the association is causal or due to confounding or reverse causality. To clarify this relationship, we adopted a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to evaluate the effects of coffee consumption on the risk of stroke and its subtypes. Method(s): A meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) including 91,462 coffee consumers was used to identify instruments for coffee consumption. Summary-level data for stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, ischemic stroke (IS), and IS subtypes were obtained from GWAS meta-analyses conducted by the MEGASTROKE consortium. MR analyses were performed using the inverse-variance-weighted, weighted-median, MR-PRESSO (Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier) test and MR-Egger regression. Sensitivity analyses were further performed using alternative instruments to test the robustness of our findings. Result(s): Genetically predicted coffee consumption (high vs infrequent/no) was not associated with risk of stroke. Similarly, among coffee consumers, MR analysis did not indicate causal associations between coffee consumption (cups/day) and risk of stroke. However, in the subgroup analysis, we found weak suggestive evidence for a potential protective effect of coffee consumption on risk of small vessel (SV)-IS, although the association did not reach statistical significance after correction for multiple comparisons. Interpretation(s): This study suggests that coffee consumption is not causally associated with risk of stroke or its subtypes. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the possible association between coffee intake and risk of SV-IS, as well as its potential underlying mechanisms.

Therefore, there is a need to identify patients at risk of developing stroke. This case-control study aimed to create and verify a gender-specific genetic signature-based nomogram to facilitate the prediction of ischemic stroke (IS) risk using only easily available clinical variables. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 1,803 IS patients and 1,456 healthy controls from the Liaoning province in China (Han population) were included which randomly divided into training cohort (70%) and validation cohort (30%) using the sample function in R software. The distribution of the pri-let-7f-2 rs17276588 variant genotype was analyzed. Following genotyping analysis, statistical analysis was used to identify relevant features. The features identified from the multivariate logistic regression, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, and univariate regression were used to create a multivariate prediction nomogram model. A calibration curve was used to determine the discrimination accuracy of the model in the training and validation cohorts. External validity was also performed. Result(s): The genotyping analysis identified the A allele as a potential risk factor for IS in both men and women. The nomogram identified the rs17276588 variant genotype and several clinical parameters, including age, diabetes mellitus, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, history of alcohol use, history of smoking, and hyperlipidemia as risk factors for developing IS. The calibration curves for the male and female models showed good consistency and applicability. Conclusion(s): The pri-let-7f-2 rs17276588 variant genotype is highly linked to the incidence of IS in the northern Chinese Han population. The nomogram we devised, which combines genetic fingerprints and clinical data, has a lot of promise for predicting the risk of IS within the Chinese Han population.Copyright © 2022 Wang, Qiu, Wang, He, Lan, Cui and Wang.","Authors":"Qiu, L.; He, Z.; Lan, X.; Cui, L.; Wang, Y.","Publisher":"Frontiers in Medicine","Issue":"Not Available","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2022.936249","Pages":"936249","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"pri-let-7f-2 variant rs17276588 & nomogram with genetic fingerprints & clinical data"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":43,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":47,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":49,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":55,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":3043,"Title":"LDL/apo B ratio predict coronary heart disease in Type 2 diabetes independent of ASCVD risk score: A case-cohort study","Year":2021,"Country":"","Abstract":"Background and aims: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a major mortality risk factor in patients with diabetes. LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) is a major risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis. There is one apolipoprotein B (ApoB) molecule in each LDL particle. We aimed to evaluate the predictive value of the LDL-C/ApoB ratio for CHD in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Methods and Results: In this case-cohort study (apo)lipoproteins and glycemic indices were measured in 1058 individuals with T2D from February 2002 to March 2019, with a median duration of follow up of 10 years. Of 1058 patients with T2D, coronary heart disease occurred in 242 patients. Increased waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and hemoglobin A1c, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)/Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) ratio, presence of hypertension and metabolic syndrome, and insulin and statin use were more prevalent among patients with CHD (P < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed that an LDL-C/ApoB ratio equal or lower than 1.2 could predict CHD independent of ASCVD risk score [adjusted OR:1.841, CI:1.257-2.698, P < 0.001] when adjusted for multiple confounders. The atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) did not predict CHD. Conclusion(s): This study showed that LDL-C/ApoB ratio, but not the atherogenic index of plasma, may be considered as an indicator of CHD independent of the ASCVD risk score in patients with T2D.

The soluble form of RAGE (sRAGE) prevents the harmful effects of AGE-RAGE signalling. The sRAGE is produced either by alternate splicing (esRAGE) or proteolytic RAGE cleavage by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10). Hence, the study aimed to compare the expression of ADAM10 in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC), serum sRAGE and esRAGE levels in T2DM patients with and without acute coronary syndrome (ACS)., METHODS: Forty-five T2DM patients with ACS and 45 age, gender and duration of DM-matched T2DM patients without ACS were recruited. Serum sRAGE and esRAGE levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expression of ADAM10 in PBMC was determined by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction., RESULTS: The expression of ADAM10 in PBMC and serum sRAGE levels were significantly lower in T2DM patients with ACS than in T2DM patients without ACS (p < 0.001). Serum sRAGE levels and expression of ADAM10 in PBMC were positively correlated with each other and negatively correlated with markers of cardiac injury and glycaemic status (p < 0.05). Simple logistic regression showed that the models containing the expression of ADAM10 and serum sRAGE level could predict the ACS risk among T2DM patients. ROC analysis showed that both might be used for ACS diagnosis in T2DM patients., CONCLUSION: Reduced expression of ADAM10 in PBMC might be responsible for lower serum sRAGE levels, predisposing T2DM patients to high ACS risk.

To systematically examine this question, we performed a Mendelian Randomization-Phenome-wide association study (MR-PheWAS) using clinical and genetic data from a national healthcare system biobank. Methods and findings Analyses were performed using data from the US Veterans Affairs (VA) Million Veteran Program in non-Hispanic White (EA, n = 222,300) and non-Hispanic Black (AA, n = 58,151) adults in the US. We estimated height genetic risk based on 3290 height-associated variants from a recent European-ancestry genome-wide meta-analysis. We compared associations of measured and genetically-predicted height with phenome-wide traits derived from the VA electronic health record, adjusting for age, sex, and genetic principal components. We found 345 clinical traits associated with measured height in EA and an additional 17 in AA. Of these, 127 were associated with genetically-predicted height at phenome-wide significance in EA and 2 in AA. These associations were largely independent from body mass index. We confirmed several previously described MR associations between height and cardiovascular disease traits such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary heart disease (CHD), and atrial fibrillation, and further uncovered MR associations with venous circulatory disorders and peripheral neuropathy in the presence and absence of diabetes. As a number of traits associated with genetically-predicted height frequently co-occur with CHD, we evaluated effect modification by CHD status of genetically-predicted height associations with risk factors for and complications of CHD. We found modification of effects of MR associations by CHD status for atrial fibrillation/flutter but not for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or venous circulatory disorders. Conclusions We conclude that height may be an unrecognized but biologically plausible risk factor for several common conditions in adults. However, more studies are needed to reliably exclude horizontal pleiotropy as a driving force behind at least some of the MR associations observed in this study.Copyright: This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

For MS gene, rs185087 was also found to be associated with CAD in a co-dominant (p = 0.003 and p = 0.03), dominant (p = 0.001) and allelic models (p = 0.001). The gene-gene interaction revealed strong epistasis between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), ESR1 rs9340799 and MTHFR rs2274976. Furthermore, the dendrogram for gene-environment dataset indicated moderately synergistic interaction between CETP rs708272 and physical inactivity., CONCLUSION: In the study under reference, a significant association of ESR1-XbaI (rs9340799), MTHFR C677T (rs1801133) and MS A2756G (rs185087) gene polymorphisms with the susceptibility of CAD in the population of Jammu region (JandK) has been observed.","Authors":"Raina, Jyotdeep Kour; Sharma, Minakashee; Panjaliya, Rakesh Kumar; Dogra, Vikas; Bakaya, Ashok; Kumar, Parvinder","Publisher":"BMC cardiovascular disorders","Issue":"1","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12872-020-01618-7","Pages":"340","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"variants in ESR1 (rs2234693 & rs9340799) & CETP (rs708272) & MTHFR (rs1801133 & rs2274976) & MS (rs185087)"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":26,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":37,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":42,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":47,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":58,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":3053,"Title":"Lower birth weight is linked to poorer cardiovascular health in middle-aged population-based adults","Year":2022,"Country":"","Abstract":"Objective: To examine associations of birth weight with clinical and imaging indicators of cardiovascular health and evaluate mechanistic pathways in the UK Biobank. Method(s): Competing risk regression was used to estimate associations of birth weight with incident myocardial infarction (MI) and mortality (all-cause, cardiovascular disease, ischaemic heart disease, MI), over 7-12 years of longitudinal follow-up, adjusting for age, sex, deprivation, maternal smoking/hypertension and maternal/paternal diabetes. Mediation analysis was used to evaluate the role of childhood growth, adulthood obesity, cardiometabolic diseases and blood biomarkers in mediating the birth weight-MI relationship. Linear regression was used to estimate associations of birth weight with left ventricular (LV) mass-to-volume ratio, LV stroke volume, global longitudinal strain, LV global function index and left atrial ejection fraction. Result(s): 258 787 participants from white ethnicities (61% women, median age 56 (49, 62) years) were studied. Birth weight had a non-linear relationship with incident MI, with a significant inverse association below an optimal threshold of 3.2 kg (subdistribution HR: 1.15 (1.08 to 1.22), p=6.0x10-5) and attenuation to the null above this threshold. The birth weight-MI effect was mediated through hypertension (8.4%), glycated haemoglobin (7.0%), C reactive protein (6.4%), high-density lipoprotein (5.2%) and high cholesterol (4.1%). Birth weight-mortality associations were statistically non-significant after Bonferroni correction. In participants with cardiovascular magnetic resonance (n=19 314), lower birth weight was associated with adverse LV remodelling (greater concentricity, poorer function). Conclusion(s): Lower birth weight was associated with greater risk of incident MI and unhealthy LV phenotypes; effects were partially mediated through cardiometabolic disease and systemic inflammation. These findings support consideration of birth weight in risk prediction and highlight actionable areas for disease prevention.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

Estrogen plays an important role in vascular homeostasis. Our aim was to elucidate whether a drop in circulating estradiol in conjunction with variants of estrogen receptor genes have a role in female gender susceptibility to aSAH. A total of 709 subjects were enrolled (349 aSAH patients, 360 controls) and genotyped for rs2234693 or PvuII (intron 1, T>C) in the ESR1 gene and rs4986938 or AluI (exon 8, 1730G>A) of ESR2 gene by PCR-RFLP. Serum estradiol was estimated by ELISA. Estrogen receptor gene expression was studied by qRT-PCR. Logistic regression analysis indicated a significant recessive effect of the T allele of PvuII on aSAH in females, and this association remained statistically significant even after adjusting for confounders (OR 1.702, CI 95% 1.062, 2.726, P value = 0.027). ESR1 gene expression was significantly reduced (P value = 0.0089) in subjects carrying PvuII T allele. In postmenopausal women with TT genotype and low serum estradiol, the odds for developing aSAH were found to be 3.5-fold increase compared with premenopausal women (CI 95% 1.424-8.828, P value = 0.0074). However, this variant showed no significant association with aSAH in men. No significant difference was found in genotype and allelic distribution of AluI polymorphism in ESR2 gene, between patients and controls. We propose that the PvuII T allele could be a potential pharmacogenetic marker for strategizing personal medicine for preventing aSAH in postmenopausal women with low circulating estradiol. Further larger studies in other population are warranted.","Authors":"Ramesh, Shruthi Shimoga; Christopher, Rita; Devi, Bhagavatula Indira; Bhat, Dhananjaya Ishwar; Shukla, Dhaval","Publisher":"The pharmacogenomics journal","Issue":"5","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41397-020-0155-4","Pages":"655-663","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"ESR1 variant rs2234693 & ESR2 variant rs4986938 & serum estradiol & estrogen receptor gene expression"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":10,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":42,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":47,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":58,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":3064,"Title":"Prediction of Coronary Artery Disease and Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events Using Clinical and Genetic Risk Scores for Cardiovascular Risk Factors","Year":2022,"Country":"","Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease (CAD) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) are the leading causes of death in the general population, but risk stratification remains suboptimal. CAD genetic risk scores (GRSs) predict risk independently from clinical tools, like QRISK3. We assessed the added value of GRSs for a variety of cardiovascular traits (CV GRSs) for predicting CAD and MACE and tested their early-life screening potential by comparing against the CAD GRS only., METHODS: We used data from 379 581 participants in the UK Biobank without known cardiovascular conditions (follow-up, 11.3 years; 3.3% CAD cases and 5.2% MACE cases). In a training subset (50%) we built 3 scores: QRISK3; QRISK3 and an established CAD GRS; and QRISK3, the CAD GRS and the CV GRSs. In an independent subset (50%), we evaluated each score's performance using the concordance index, odds ratio and net reclassification index. We then repeated the analyses without considering QRISK3., RESULTS: For CAD, the combination of QRISK3 and the CAD GRS had a better performance than QRISK3 alone (concordance index, 0.766 versus 0.753; odds ratio, 5.47 versus 4.82; net reclassification index, 7.7%). Adding the CV GRSs did not significantly improve risk stratification. When only looking at genetic information, the combination of CV GRSs and the CAD GRS had a better performance than the CAD GRS alone (concordance index, 0.637 versus 0.625; odds ratio, 2.17 versus 2.07; net reclassification index, 3.3%). Similar results were obtained for MACE., CONCLUSIONS: In individuals without known cardiovascular disease, the inclusion of CV GRSs to a clinical tool and an established CAD GRS does not improve CAD or MACE risk stratification. However, their combination only with the CAD GRS increases prediction performance indicating potential use in early-life screening before the advanced development of conventional cardiovascular risk factors.","Authors":"Ramirez, Julia; van Duijvenboden, Stefan; Young, William J.; Tinker, Andrew; Lambiase, Pier D.; Orini, Michele; Munroe, Patricia B.","Publisher":"Circulation.

We sought whether disease stage influenced the prediction of AF by echocardiography. Method(s): We compared a PP cohort (351 community-based participants >=65 years with >=1 risk factor for AF) and a SP cohort (453 patients after transient ischemic attack or stroke). LV global longitudinal strain (GLS) and left atrial reservoir strain (LARS) were measured from DICOM images. AF was diagnosed by 12 lead ECG, Holter or by single lead monitor over median follow-up of 22 months (PP) and 35 months (SP). The clinical and echocardiographic characteristics of those with AF were compared to those in sinus rhythm. Nested Cox-regression models assessed for independent and incremental predictive value of LARS and GLS in both cohorts. Result(s): AF developed in 42 PP (12%) and 60 SP (13%), and was associated with age, higher CHARGE-AF score, increased LA volume and LV mass (p < 0.05). Patients developing AF had reduced GLS (17 +/- 3.5% vs. 20 +/- 3%, p < 0.001) and LARS (28 +/- 11% vs. 35 +/- 8%, p < 0.001). However, the predictive value of both GLS (area under the ROC curve 0.83 vs 0.56, p < 0.001) and LARS (0.83 vs 0.57, p < 0.001) was greater in SP than PP. LARS was independently associated with AF in both cohorts (p < 0.05), but GLS was only independently associated in the SP cohort. Conclusion(s): AF risk assessment with LARS is suitable for different risk cohorts, but GLS is more useful in SP.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Authors":"Ramkumar, S.; Pathan, F.; Kawakami, H.; Ochi, A.; Yang, H.; Potter, E.

The serum vaspin concentration was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Real-time PCR was performed to detect the mRNA expression of vaspin. Serum vaspin and vaspin expression levels were significantly higher in IS compared to the non-IS group. Interestingly, they were positively correlated with other vascular and metabolic risks. Diastolic and systolic blood pressure, as well as hemoglobin A1c cholesterol (HbA1c), were independently correlated with serum vaspin.

Genome-born elements contribute substantially to the atherosclerosis process. ANRIL is one of the long non-coding RNAs with outstanding functions particularly regulation of genes involved in atherosclerosis development. In this study, we measured ANRIL expression (circular-, linear-, and circular/linear ratio) in hypertensive patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) compared with peers without CAD. Among hypertensive patients who were candidates of angiography, 25 subjects with CAD and the equal number without CAD were considered as the case and control groups, respectively. Different categories of data were recorded through a predefined questionnaire. Before angiography, blood samples were obtained. After RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis, quantitative PCR was performed using specific primers for circular and linear ANRIL. Age and gender were not different between the groups. Most of the parameters of the lipid profile besides creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were remarkably worse in the case group. Circular ANRIL was significantly lower in the case group while linear counterparts were significantly higher in this group. Circular/linear ratio was also significantly lower in the case group. To overcome growing devastating trend of CAD, scrutinizing different factors involved in the initiation and development of atherosclerosis is a must.

A matched case-control study was nested in the PREDIMED trial, in which participants were randomized to three arms: MedDiet with tree nut supplementation group, MedDiet with extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) supplementation group or control group (low-fat diet). One hundred and sixty-seven PAD cases were matched with 250 controls. Plasma AA was measured with liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry at the Broad Institute. Baseline tryptophan, serine and threonine were inversely associated with PAD (ORfor 1 SD increase = 0.78 (0.61-0.99); 0.67 (0.51-0.86) and 0.75 (0.59-0.95), respectively) in a multivariable-adjusted conditional logistic regression model. The kynurenine/tryptophan ratio was directly associated with PAD (ORfor 1 SD increase = 1.50 (1.14-1.98)). The nutritional intervention with the MedDiet+nuts modified the association between threonine and PAD (p-value interaction = 0.018) compared with the control group. However, subjects allocated to the MedDiet+EVOO group were protected against PAD independently of baseline threonine. Plasma tryptophan, kynurenine/tryptophan ratio, serine and threonine might serve as early biomarkers of future PAD in subjects at a high risk of cardiovascular disease.

Repeat analyses after exclusion of genes associated with impaired VLDL secretion showed consistent associations between genetically predicted NAFLD and CAD for all traits (i.e., cALT [OR: 1.203, 95% CI: 1.113, 1.300]), imaging-based (OR: 2.149, 95% CI: 1.276, 3.620) and biopsy-confirmed NAFLD (OR: 1.113, 95% CI: 1.041, 1.189), which persisted when more stringent biopsy-confirmed NAFLD criteria were used (OR: 1.154, 95% CI: 1.043, 1.278) or when more stringent MR methods were applied. MR-Egger regression did not show a statistically significant intercept., CONCLUSION: The two-sample MR analyses showed a robust association between genetically predicted NAFLD and CAD after exclusion of genetic variants that are implicated in impaired VLDL secretion.

Numerous published risk prediction models used for CVD risk assessment are based on conventional risk factors and include only a limited number of biomarkers. The addition of novel biomarkers can boost the discriminative ability of risk prediction models for CVDs with different pathogenesis. The present study reports the development of risk prediction models for a range of heterogeneous CVDs, including coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), as well as for Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), a major CVD risk factor. In addition to conventional risk factors, the models incorporate various blood biomarkers and comorbidities to improve both individual and population stratification. An automatic variable selection approach was developed to generate the best set of explanatory variables for each model from the initial panel of risk factors. In total, up to 254,220 UK Biobank participants (ranging from 215,269 to 254,220 for different CVDs and DM2) were included in the analyses. The derived prediction models utilizing Cox proportional hazards regression achieved consistent discrimination performance (C-index) for all diseases: CAD, 0.794 (95% CI, 0.787-0.801); DM2, 0.909 (95% CI, 0.903-0.916); stroke, 0.778 (95% CI, 0.756-0.801); DVT, 0.743 (95% CI, 0.737-0.749); and AAA, 0.893 (95% CI, 0.874-0.912). When validated on various subpopulations, they demonstrated higher discrimination in healthier and middle-age individuals. In general, calibration of a five-year risk of developing the CVDs and DM2 demonstrated incremental overestimation of disease-related conditions amongst the highest decile of risk probabilities. In summary, the risk prediction models described were validated with high discrimination and good calibration for several CVDs and DM2. These models incorporate multiple shared predictor variables and may be integrated into a single platform to enhance clinical stratification to impact health outcomes.Copyright: © 2020 Rezaee et al.

The H19 gene plays a functional role in increasing the prevalence of IS risk factors. We evaluated the correlation between H19 rs217727 polymorphism and the expression level of H19 lncRNA with susceptibility to IS among the Iranian population. Method(s): Blood samples were collected from IS patients (n = 114) and controls (n = 114). We concentrated on the expression pattern of H19 at different time points (i.e., 0-24, 24-48, and 48-72 h after stroke). The tetra-amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction (T-ARMS-PCR) method was applied for DNA genotyping. We used the quantitative real-time PCR to evaluate H19 expression levels. We used the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to evaluate the diagnosis and prognosis of IS. Result(s): The rs217727polymorphism of H19 was related with IS susceptibility in the co-dominant (OR = 2.92, 95% CI = 0.91-10.92, P = 0.04) and recessive models (OR = 2.80, 95% CI = 0.96-8.15, P = 0.04). H19 expression was significantly upregulated in IS and remained high for 72 h after stroke. ROC curves showed that H19 expression within the first 24 h from stroke onset might serve as a biomarker for the early diagnosis of IS with 79.49% sensitivity and 80.00% specificity. H19 expression in small vessel occlusion (SVO) and large-artery atherosclerosis (LAA) patients were 3.74 and 3.34 times higher than the undetermined (UD) subtype, respectively [OR = 3.74 95% CL (1.14-12.27) P = 0.030 and OR = 3.34 95% CL (1.13-9.85) P = 0.029]. Conclusion(s): The rs217727 polymorphism of the H19 is correlated with IS susceptibility, and H19 expression levels were higher in SVO and LAA patients. The upregulation of H19 may be considered as a diagnostic biomarker in IS among the Iranian population, but it cannot serve as a useful prognostic marker.Copyright © 2021, BioMed Central Ltd.

However, little evidence was found of a direct effect (ie, not through adult body size) based on multivariable mendelian randomisation estimates (coronary artery disease: 1.02, 0.86 to 1.22; type 2 diabetes:1.16, 0.74 to 1.82). In the multivariable mendelian randomisation analysis of breast cancer risk, strong evidence was found of a protective direct effect for larger body size in early life (0.59, 0.50 to 0.71), with less evidence of a direct effect of adult body size on this outcome (1.08, 0.93 to 1.27). Including age at menarche as an additional exposure provided weak evidence of a total causal effect (univariable mendelian randomisation odds ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.91 to 1.06) but strong evidence of a direct causal effect, independent of early life and adult body size (multivariable mendelian randomisation odds ratio 0.90, 0.85 to 0.95). No strong evidence was found of a causal effect of either early or later life measures on prostate cancer (early life body size odds ratio 1.06, 95% confidence interval 0.81 to 1.40; adult body size 0.87, 0.70 to 1.08)., CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the positive association between body size in childhood and risk of coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes in adulthood can be attributed to individuals remaining large into later life. However, having a smaller body size during childhood might increase the risk of breast cancer regardless of body size in adulthood, with timing of puberty also putatively playing a role.

Polygenic scores (PGS) aggregate these into a metric representing an individual's genetic predisposition to disease. PGS have shown promise for early risk prediction4-7 and there is an open question as to whether PGS can also be used to understand disease biology8. Here, we demonstrate that cardiometabolic disease PGS can be used to elucidate the proteins underlying disease pathogenesis. In 3,087 healthy individuals, we found that PGS for coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease and ischaemic stroke are associated with the levels of 49 plasma proteins. Associations were polygenic in architecture, largely independent of cis and trans protein quantitative trait loci and present for proteins without quantitative trait loci. Over a follow-up of 7.7 years, 28 of these proteins associated with future myocardial infarction or type 2 diabetes events, 16 of which were mediators between polygenic risk and incident disease. Twelve of these were druggable targets with therapeutic potential. Our results demonstrate the potential for PGS to uncover causal disease biology and targets with therapeutic potential, including those that may be missed by approaches utilizing information at a single locus.

Despite this high incidence, there is a limited understanding of the molecular mechanism of this disease, and no medical therapy is available for this disease. We aimed to elucidate the genetic basis of MVP in order to better understand this complex disorder., METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a meta-analysis of six genome-wide association studies that included 4884 cases and 434 649 controls. We identified 14 loci associated with MVP in our primary analysis and 2 additional loci associated with a subset of the samples that additionally underwent mitral valve surgery. Integration of epigenetic, transcriptional, and proteomic data identified candidate MVP genes including LMCD1, SPTBN1, LTBP2, TGFB2, NMB, and ALPK3. We created a polygenic risk score (PRS) for MVP and showed an improved MVP risk prediction beyond age, sex, and clinical risk factors., CONCLUSION: We identified 14 genetic loci that are associated with MVP. Multiple analyses identified candidate genes including two transforming growth factor-beta signalling molecules and spectrin beta. We present the first PRS for MVP that could eventually aid risk stratification of patients for MVP screening in a clinical setting. These findings advance our understanding of this common valvular heart disease and may reveal novel therapeutic targets for intervention. Copyright © The Author(s) 2022.

TAA is a heritable disease that can be potentially life threatening. While 10%-20% of TAA cases are caused by rare, pathogenic variants in single genes, the origin of the majority of TAA cases remains unknown. A previous study implicated common variants in FBN1 with TAA disease risk. Here, we report a genome-wide scan of 1,351 TAA-affected individuals and 18,295 control individuals from the Cardiovascular Health Improvement Project and Michigan Genomics Initiative at the University of Michigan. We identified a genome-wide significant association with TAA for variants within the third intron of TCF7L2 following replication with meta-analysis of four additional independent cohorts. Common variants in this locus are the strongest known genetic risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Although evidence indicates the presence of different causal variants for TAA and type 2 diabetes at this locus, we observed an opposite direction of effect. The genetic association for TAA colocalizes with an aortic eQTL of TCF7L2, suggesting a functional relationship. These analyses predict an association of higher expression of TCF7L2 with TAA disease risk. In vitro, we show that upregulation of TCF7L2 is associated with BCL2 repression promoting vascular smooth muscle cell apoptosis, a key driver of TAA disease.

Methods AI-enabled retinal vessel image analysis processed images from 88 052 UK Biobank (UKB) participants (aged 40-69 years at image capture) and 7411 European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC)-Norfolk participants (aged 48-92). Retinal arteriolar and venular width, tortuosity and area were extracted. Prediction models were developed in UKB using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression for circulatory mortality, incident stroke and MI, and externally validated in EPIC-Norfolk. Model performance was assessed using optimism adjusted calibration, C-statistics and R 2 statistics. Performance of Framingham risk scores (FRS) for incident stroke and incident MI, with addition of RV to FRS, were compared with a simpler model based on RV, age, smoking status and medical history (antihypertensive/cholesterol lowering medication, diabetes, prevalent stroke/MI). Results UKB prognostic models were developed on 65 144 participants (mean age 56.8; median follow-up 7.7 years) and validated in 5862 EPIC-Norfolk participants (67.6, 9.1 years, respectively). Prediction models for circulatory mortality in men and women had optimism adjusted C-statistics and R 2 statistics between 0.75-0.77 and 0.33-0.44, respectively. For incident stroke and MI, addition of RV to FRS did not improve model performance in either cohort. However, the simpler RV model performed equally or better than FRS. Conclusion RV offers an alternative predictive biomarker to traditional risk-scores for vascular health, without the need for blood sampling or blood pressure measurement. Further work is needed to examine RV in population screening to triage individuals at high-risk.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022. Re-use permitted under CC BY.

Biomarkers are useful prognostic predictors of IHD, but their long-term predictive value in a general population has not been adequately studied. Purpose(s): To investigate the early predictive value of multi-modality biomarkers in addition to clinical risk factors in incident IHD in a random male general population sample followed from 50 to 71 years of age. Method(s): \"The Study of Men Born in 1943\" is a longitudinal cohort study during follow-up. All the men underwent a baseline examination in 1993, where a panel of biomarkers were analysed and incident IHD was registered during 21-year follow-ups. Result(s): Of 739 participants, 97 men (13.1%) developed an IHD event. For time to first occurrence of IHD, univariable analyses showed that elevated levels of high sensitivity troponin T (hs-TNT), high sensitivity-C reactive protein (hs-CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were significant predictors of IHD. In addition, a high number of biomarkers with elevated levels (hs-TNT > 10 ng/L, hs-CRP > 1 mg/L, IL-6 > 8 ng/L and N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) > 100 pg/mL) increased predictive ability. In univariable and multivariable analysis high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) had the highest predictive ability. Hs-TNT provided better predictive ability than smoking, body mass index and glucose, and was an independent significant predictor when adjusted for HDL-C, total cholesterol and hypertension. Addition of biomarkers on top of clinical risk factors provided significantly better prediction as tested by likelihood ratio test (p = 0.033), but did not significantly enhance the model's discriminative ability However, it appeared contributing to higher sensitivity in the late phase of follow-up. Conclusion(s): In this random, middle-aged male population sample, the addition of biomarker hs-TNT was an independent significant predictor of IHD and significantly improved prediction, indicating the probability of a better prediction of long-term risk of IHD in a low-risk population.

The Val34Leu polymorphism is one of the most commonly analysed FXIII polymorphisms. However, studies on the role of the Val34Leu polymorphism in the aetiology of vascular diseases often show contradictory results. In the present meta-analysis, we aimed to pool data from available articles to assess the relationship between the FXIII Val34Leu polymorphism and the susceptibilities to IS of undetermined source and premature MI in patients aged below 55 years. Method(s): We searched databases (PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, SciELO, and Medline) using specific keywords (the last search was in January 2022). Eventually, 18 studies (627 cases and 1639 controls for IS; 2595 cases and 4255 controls for MI) met the inclusion criteria. Data were analysed using RevMan 5.4 and StatsDirect 3 link software. The relation between Val34Leu polymorphism and disease was analysed in five genetic models, i.e., dominant, recessive, additive, heterozygous, and allelic. Result(s): No relation between Val34Leu polymorphism and IS in young adults was observed in all analysed genetic models. For premature MI, significant pooled OR was found between the carrier state of the Leu allele (Val/Leu + Leu/Leu vs. Val/Val) and a lack of MI, suggesting its protective role (OR = 0.80 95%CI 0.64-0.99, p = 0.04). A similar finding was observed for the heterozygous model in MI (Val/Leu vs. Val/Val) (OR = 0.77 95%CI 0.61-0.98, p = 0.03). No relation was found for the recessive, additive, and allelic models in MI. Conclusion(s): In the population of young adults, no positive correlation was found between the FXIII Val34Leu polymorphism and IS of undetermined source in any of the analysed genetic models. In turn, the carrier state of the 34Leu allele as well as FXIII heterozygotes themselves were found to play a protective role in relation to premature MI.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

Polymorphisms in NRF2 and its target antioxidant genes: HMOX-1, NQO1, and MT, have been associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and diabetes in various ethnic groups, however, with variable results. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of NRF2, HMOX-1, NQO1, and MT gene polymorphisms with CVD risk factors in Thais. The study was conducted in two groups: group with high-risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) and health check-up group. Polymorphisms in NRF2 (rs6721961), NQO1 (rs1800566), MT1A (rs11640851), and HMOX-1 (rs2071746) were genotyped. Expressions of NRF2, HMOX-1, and NQO1 were also determined. In high-risk group, NRF2 rs6721961-TT was associated with CAD [OR (95% CI) 5.07 (1.42-18.10)] and severity of coronary atherosclerosis [Gensini score > 32, OR (95% CI) 4.31 (1.67-11.09)]; rs6721961 GT and TT revealed significant association with lower mRNA expression than GG (p = 0.021). NQO1 rs1800566 also revealed association with CAD, only in female. Combined effect of NQO1-rs1800566, HMOX1-rs2071746, and MT1A-rs11640851 was evaluated on the risks of DM and hypertension. With a combination of risk alleles as genetic risk score (GRS), the highest GRS (score 6) increased risk for hypertension, comparing with GRS 0-2 [OR (95% CI) 1.89 (1.02-3.49)]; group with score 5-6 revealed association with risk of DM [OR (95% CI) 1.481 (1.08-2.04)].

We examined associations of genetically predicted Lp(a) levels with (1) atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease subtypes: coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, and abdominal aortic aneurysm and (2) nonatherosclerotic cardiovascular disease phenotypes, stratified by ancestry., METHODS: We performed (1) Mendelian randomization analyses for previously reported cardiovascular associations and (2) Mendelian randomization-phenome-wide association analyses for novel associations. Analyses were stratified by ancestry in electronic Medical Records and Genomics, United Kingdom Biobank, and Million Veteran Program cohorts separately and in a combined cohort of 804 507 EA and 103 580 AA participants., RESULTS: In Mendelian randomization analyses using the combined cohort, a 1-SD genetic increase in Lp(a) level was associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease subtypes in EA-odds ratio and 95% CI for coronary heart disease 1.28 (1.16-1.41); cerebrovascular disease 1.14 (1.07-1.21); peripheral artery disease 1.22 (1.11-1.34); abdominal aortic aneurysm 1.28 (1.17-1.40); in AA, the effect estimate was lower than in EA and nonsignificant for coronary heart disease 1.11 (0.99-1.24) and cerebrovascular disease 1.06 (0.99-1.14) but similar for peripheral artery disease 1.16 (1.01-1.33) and abdominal aortic aneurysm 1.34 (1.11-1.62).

We aimed to verify recently reported risk genes and to identify novel sequence variants involved in the etiology of UIA/aSAH. Method(s): We performed exome sequencing (ES) in 35 unrelated individuals and 3 family members, each with a history of UIA and/or aSAH. We searched for sequence variants with minor allele frequency (MAF) <= 5% in the reported risk genes ADAMTS15, ANGPTL6, ARHGEF17, LOXL2, PCNT, RNF213, THSD1 and TMEM132B. To identify novel putative risk genes we looked for unknown (MAF = 0) variants shared by the three relatives. Result(s): We identified 20 variants with MAF <= 5% in 18 individuals: 9 variants in PCNT (9 patients), 4 in RNF213 (3 patients), 3 in THSD1 (6 patients), 2 in ANGPTL6 (3 patients), 1 in ADAMTS15 (1 patient) and 1 in TMEM132B (1 patient). In the affected family, prioritization of shared sequence variants yielded five novel putative risk genes. Based on predicted pathogenicity of identified variants, population genetics data and a high functional relevance for vascular biology, EDIL3 was selected as top candidate and screened in additional 37 individuals with UIA and/or aSAH: a further very rare EDIL3 sequence variant in two unrelated sporadic patients was identified. Conclusion(s): Our data support a role of sequence variants in PCNT, RNF213 and THSD1 as susceptibility factors for cerebrovascular disease. The documented function in vascular wall integrity, the crucial localization of affected amino acids and gene/variant association tests suggest EDIL3 as a further valid candidate disease gene for UIA/aSAH.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).","Authors":"Sauvigny, T.; Alawi, M.; Krause, L.; Renner, S.; Spohn, M.; Busch, A.; Kolbe, V.; Altmuller, J.; Loscher, B.

Few interventions have focused on protecting specifically men. Emerging evidence may implicate testosterone. Neurokinin 3 receptor (NK3R) antagonists, an existing class of drugs being considered as treatments for reproductive conditions in women, affect testosterone; this study addresses genetic validation of their use to prevent IHD in men. Method(s): A one-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study using the UK Biobank cohort study, based on independent (r2 < 0.005) genetic variants predicting testosterone in men (n = 157738) at genome wide significance in the target gene for NK3R antagonists (TACR3), was used to assess associations with IHD (cases=15056, non-cases=151964) and positive control outcomes (relative age voice broke, children fathered, hypertension) in men and a negative control outcome (IHD) in women using summary statistics. A two-sample MR study using the PRACTICAL consortium was used for the positive control outcome of prostate cancer. Finding(s): Two relevant TACR3 genetic variants (rs116646027 and rs1351623) were identified in men. Genetically mimicked NK3R antagonists were inversely associated with IHD (odds ratio 0.54 per standard deviation lower testosterone, 95% confidence interval 0.31, 0.94) and with control outcomes (older relative age voice broke, fewer children and lower risk of hypertension and prostate cancer) as expected in men and in women (unrelated to IHD). Interpretation(s): Genetic validation of a role of NK3R antagonists in IHD suggests their consideration as a new means of preventing IHD in men. Whether they protect against prostate cancer might bear further consideration.Copyright © 2022 The Author","Authors":"Schooling, C.

In clinical studies, elevated TML levels predicted major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with acute or stable coronary artery disease (CAD). In contrast to cardiovascular patients, the role of TML in patients with acute cerebral ischemia is unknown. Here, we evaluated circulating TML levels in 374 stroke patients from the prospective biomarkers in stroke (MARK-STROKE) study. Compared with 167 matched healthy controls, acute ischemic stroke patients had lower median TML plasma concentrations, i.e. 0.71 vs. 0.47 micromol/L (p < 0.001) and this difference persisted after adjusting for age and sex. TML plasma concentrations were associated with age, serum creatinine, glucose, cholesterol and lysine. Patients with prevalent arterial hypertension, atrial fibrillation or a history of myocardial infarction had increased TML levels, but this observation was not independent of age, sex and GFR. In 274 patients, follow-up data were available. During a median follow-up of 284 [25th-75th percentile: 198, 431] days, TML was not associated with incident MACE (stroke, myocardial infarction, death).

Genetic predisposition to endothelial dysfunction has been associated with IHD and its clinical manifestation. However, studies are often confounding and inconclusive for several rea-sons, such as interethnic differences. Validation of results in larger cohorts and new populations is needed. The aim of this study is to evaluate the associations between the allelic variants of the eNOS rs1799983 single-nucleotide polymorphism, IHD susceptibility and its clinical presentation. Meth-ods: A total of 362 consecutive patients with suspected myocardial ischemia were enrolled. Patients were divided into three groups: G1, coronary artery disease (CAD); G2, coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD); and G3, a control group with anatomically and functionally normal coronary arteries. Analysis of three allelic variants, GT, GG and TT, of rs1799983 for the NOS3 gene, encoding for eNOS, was performed. Result(s): rs1799983_GT was significantly more expressed by the ischemic groups (G1 and G2) compared to G3. The TT variant was significantly more expressed by the G1 group, compared to the G2 group. Among ischemic patients, GT was significantly more expressed in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) presentation, compared to other clinical presenta-tions. In the multivariate analysis, the allelic variant GT was found to potentially represent an independent predictor of IHD and ACS presentation. Conclusion(s): The presence of the SNP rs1799983_GT, encoding for eNOS, is an independent risk factor for IHD and, remarkably, for ACS presentation, independently of cardiovascular risk factors. These results may be useful for the prediction of IHD development, particularly with an acute clinical manifestation. They may allow the early identification of patients at high risk of developing IHD with an ACS, promoting a genetic-based prevention strategy against IHD.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

Individuals with type 2 diabetes with good glycaemic control and normoalbuminuria had slightly increased risk.","Authors":"Seyed Ahmadi, Shilan; Svensson, Ann-Marie; Pivodic, Aldina; Rosengren, Annika; Lind, Marcus","Publisher":"Cardiovascular diabetology","Issue":"1","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12933-019-0983-1","Pages":"9","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"albuminuria & estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":10,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":3,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":15,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":42,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":47,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":49,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":52,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":3354,"Title":"Low-grade inflammation as a risk factor for cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes","Year":2021,"Country":"","Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes is a condition associated with a state of low-grade inflammation caused by adipose tissue dysfunction and insulin resistance. High sensitive-CRP (hs-CRP) is a marker for systemic low-grade inflammation and higher plasma levels have been associated with cardiovascular events in various populations. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the relation between hs-CRP and incident cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality in high-risk type 2 diabetes patients., METHODS: Prospective cohort study of 1679 type 2 diabetes patients included in the Second Manifestations of ARTerial disease (SMART). Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate the risk of hs-CRP on cardiovascular events (composite of myocardial infarction, stroke and vascular mortality) and all-cause mortality. Hs-CRP was log-transformed for continuous analyses. Findings were adjusted for age, sex, BMI, current smoking and alcohol use, non-HDL-cholesterol and micro-albuminuria., RESULTS: 307 new cardiovascular events and 343 deaths occurred during a median follow-up of 7.8 years (IQR 4.2-11.1). A one unit increase in log(hs-CRP) was related to an increased vascular- and all-cause mortality risk (HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.01-1.46 and HR 1.26, 95% CI 1.10-1.45 respectively). No relation was found between log(hs-CRP) and myocardial infarction or stroke. The relations were similar in patients with and without previous vascular disease., CONCLUSION: Low grade inflammation, as measured by hs-CRP, is an independent risk factor for vascular- and all-cause mortality but not for cardiovascular events in high-risk type 2 diabetes patients. Chronic low-grade inflammation may be a treatment target to lower residual cardiovascular risk in type 2 diabetes patients. Copyright © 2021.

The evaluation of newly recognized LBBB includes screening for structural heart abnormalities and coronary artery disease (CAD). In patients whose LV ejection fraction (EF) is preserved during initial testing, the incidence of subsequent cardiomyopathy is not firmly established. Hypothesis: The risk of developing LV systolic dysfunction among LBBB patients with preserved LVEF is high enough to warrant serial imaging. Method(s): We screened records of 1000 consecutive patients with LBBB from our ECG database and identified subjects with an initially preserved LVEF (>=45%) without clinically relevant CAD or other cause for cardiomyopathy. Baseline imaging, clinical data, and follow-up imaging were recorded to determine the risk of subsequent LV systolic dysfunction (LVEF <=40%). Result(s): (Data are mean + SD) 784 subjects were excluded, the majority for CAD or depressed LVEF upon initial imaging. Of the remaining 216, 37 (17%) developed a decline in LVEF(<=40%) over a mean follow-up of 55 +/- 31 months; 94% of these patients had a baseline LVEF<=60% and LV end systolic diameter (ESD) >= 2.9 cm indicating that these measures may be useful to define which patients warrant longitudinal follow-up. The negative predictive value of a LVEF>60% and LVESD <2.9 cm was 98%. Conclusion(s): Seventeen percent of patients with LBBB and initial preserved LVEF develop dyssynchrony cardiomyopathy. We believe the risk of developing dyssynchrony cardiomyopathy is high enough to warrant serial assessment of LV systolic function in this high-risk population.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

It remains difficult to treat brain injury and improve functional rehabilitation after cerebral ischemia. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is involved in ischemic stroke (IS) through interactions in the CREB1-BDNF-NTRk2 pathway. In this study, we aimed to determine the association of NTRK2 gene polymorphisms and the effects of intergenetic interactions in the Chinese population. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 400 patients diagnosed with IS and 400 healthy controls were enrolled for genotyping. Detailed sequence-based analysis was predicted through bioinformatical investigation. Polymorphisms associated with miRNA were analyzed by a dual-luciferase reporter assay system. Result(s): Analysis of clinical characteristics revealed that IS was highly associated with exposure to cigarette smoking, alcohol intake, as well as metabolic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, and higher serum triglyceride concentration. Three polymorphisms in NTRK2 located in the 3-untranslated region (3-UTR) were genotyped. Logistic regression analysis showed that IS patients with rs11140793, rs7047042, and rs1221 polymorphisms had a higher risk of stroke and indicated a worse short-term recovery. The mRNA level of NTRK2 was suppressed in a mutant genotype compared with wild genotype. The suppression of NTRK2 was induced by the gain-of-binding ability of certain miRNAs through the direct binding of 3-UTR. Conclusion(s): Our research indicated that, by influencing the expression of NTRK2, the SNPs rs11140793, rs7047042, and rs1221 in the 3'UTR of NTRK2 can be used as risk factors for IS patients.Copyright © 2020 Shi et al.","Authors":"Shi, J.; Sun, Y.; Hua, J.","Publisher":"Pharmacogenomics and Personalized Medicine","Issue":"Not Available","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.2147/PGPM.S270319","Pages":"577-584","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"3 variants in the 3ʹ-UTR region of NTRK2 rs11140793 & rs7047042 & rs1221"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":3,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":19,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":42,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":46,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":49,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":52,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":3390,"Title":"The contribution of plasma uric acid to the risk of stroke in hypertensive populations","Year":2020,"Country":"","Abstract":"BACKGROUND: There is limited available evidence of a relationship between uric acid (UA) level and stroke in hypertensive populations worldwide. We aimed to estimate the relationship between UA level and stroke in Chinese hypertensive populations., METHODS: A total of 4 710 essentially hypertensive Chinese patients, including 307 with stroke, were recruited consecutively by cluster sampling from 60 communities in Shenzhen from April 2010 to September 2011. Demographic characteristics, UA level and stroke diagnosis were collected from every participant. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the association between UA level and stroke., RESULTS: The study population comprised 2 361 females and 2 349 males, with a mean age of 58 +/- 11.75 years. There were significant associations between UA level and stroke and ischaemic stroke (IS) risk for females in the crude model (M0), model 1 (M1) and model 2 (M2), with increasing odds ratios (OR) as the quartiles (Q) increased. The odds of stroke risk was highest in Q4 in M2 (UA > 396 micromol/l, OR: 3.05, 95% CI: 1.74-5.36 and OR: 3.19, 95% CI: 1.74-5.85), but not for males in M0, M1 and M2. A significant dose-response relationship existed between UA level and stroke, and between UA level and IS for females but not for males. Hyperuricaemia (HU) was also significantly associated with stroke and IS for females but not for males. Taking negative uric acid, homocysteine, triglycerides, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (UA-Hcy-TG-TC-LDL-C-) as the reference, the combinations of UA+Hcy+TG-TC-LDL-, UA+Hcy+TG+TC+LDL-C- and UA+Hcy+TG+TC+LDL-C+ were significantly associated with the risk of stroke for females (OR = 2.48, 7.85 and 3.04)., CONCLUSIONS: High UA level could significantly increase stroke risk in female hypertensive patients.

Objective(s): Defining the genetic mediating mechanisms could lead to improved targeted therapies to mitigate AF risk. Method(s): We used 2-sample mendelian randomization (MR) to test associations between TSH-associated single-nucleotide variations and 16 candidate mediators. We then performed multivariable mendelian randomization (MVMR) to test for a significant attenuation of the genetic association between TSH and AF, after adjusting for each mediator significantly associated with TSH. Result(s): Four candidate mediators (free thyroxine, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and height) were significantly inversely associated with genetically predicted TSH after adjusting for multiple testing. In MVMR analyses, adjusting for height significantly decreased the magnitude of the association between TSH and AF from -0.12 (SE 0.02) occurrences of AF per SD change in height to -0.06 (0.02) (P=.005). Adjusting for the other candidate mediators did not significantly attenuate the association. Conclusion(s): The genetic association between TSH and increased AF risk is mediated, in part, by taller stature. Thus, some genetic mechanisms underlying TSH variability may contribute to AF risk through mechanisms determining height occurring early in life that differ from those driven by thyroid hormone-level elevations in later life.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

Studies examining surrogate markers of genetic susceptibility to AF, such as family history and individual AF susceptibility alleles, suggest these may be associated with recurrence outcomes. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to test the association between AF genetic susceptibility and recurrence after ablation using a comprehensive polygenic risk score for AF. Method(s): Ten centers from the AF Genetics Consortium identified patients who had undergone de novo AF ablation. AF genetic susceptibility was measured using a previously described polygenic risk score (N=929 single-nucleotide polymorphisms) and tested for an association with clinical characteristics and time-to-recurrence with a 3 month blanking period. Recurrence was defined as >30 seconds of AF, atrial flutter, or atrial tachycardia. Multivariable analysis adjusted for age, sex, height, body mass index, persistent AF, hypertension, coronary disease, left atrial size, left ventricular ejection fraction, and year of ablation. Result(s): Four thousand two hundred seventy-six patients were eligible for analysis of baseline characteristics and 3259 for recurrence outcomes. The overall arrhythmia recurrence rate between 3 and 12 months was 44% (1443/3259). Patients with higher AF genetic susceptibility were younger (P<0.001) and had fewer clinical risk factors for AF (P=0.001). Persistent AF (hazard ratio [HR], 1.39 [95% CI, 1.22-1.58]; P<0.001), left atrial size (per cm: HR, 1.32 [95% CI, 1.19-1.46]; P<0.001), and left ventricular ejection fraction (per 10%: HR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.80-0.97]; P=0.008) were associated with increased risk of recurrence. In univariate analysis, higher AF genetic susceptibility trended towards a higher risk of recurrence (HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.99-1.18]; P=0.07), which became less significant in multivariable analysis (HR, 1.06 [95% CI, 0.98-1.15]; P=0.13). Conclusion(s): Higher AF genetic susceptibility was associated with younger age and fewer clinical risk factors but not recurrence.

Genetic polymorphism in major antioxidant genes like Glutathione- S-Transferases (GST) has been associated with increased CAD susceptibility and severity., OBJECTIVE: To get a precise evaluation and to update the association, a meta-analysis on GST (GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1) polymorphism with CAD was performed. Moreover, the combined effect of GSTM1/GSTT1 null genotypes on CAD risk has not yet been studied, but it has the highest risk of developing diseases., MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were systematically searched for eligible studies. Case-control studies in the English language and with genotypic frequency were selected in order to provide data and calculate the odds ratio (OR). OR with 95% CI was calculated, and a random effect model was used. NOS scale was used to assess the quality of the included studies., RESULTS: Meta-analysis indicated that the GSTM1 null genotype and GSTP1 (Ile105Val) polymorphism is significantly associated with CAD risk with a pooled OR-1.38, p=0.01 for GSTM1 and OR-1.19, p=0.04 for GSTP1. The dual null genotype of GSTM1-GSTT1 has the highest risk for CAD development (OR-1.59, p=0.003), and there is no significant association between GSTT1 null genotype with CAD. In the subgroup analysis, GSTM1 showed an increased risk for Asians (OR- 1.68, p=<0.01) and smokers (OR-1.98, p=<0.01). Publication bias was not observed., CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that the GSTM1 and GSTP1 polymorphism can be a predictive factor for CAD risk, and a larger sample size is required further to confirm the association.

This study aimed to identify proteomic signatures and pathways related to these risk loci to better characterize AAA genetic susceptibility. Method(s): Plasma concentrations of 4870 proteins were determined using a DNA aptamer-based array. Linear regression analysis estimated the associations between the 23 risk alleles and plasma protein levels with adjustments for potential confounders in a race-stratified analysis of 1671 Black and 7241 White participants. Significant proteins were then evaluated for their prediction of clinical AAA (454 AAA events in 11 064 individuals), and those significantly associated with AAA were further interrogated using Mendelian randomization analysis. Result(s): Risk variants proximal to PSRC1-CELSR2-SORT1, PCIF1-ZNF335-MMP9, RP11-136O12.2/TRIB1, ZNF259/APOA5, IL6R, PCSK9, LPA, and APOE were associated with 118 plasma proteins in Whites and 59 were replicated in Black participants. Novel associations with clinical AAA incidence were observed for kit ligand (HR, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.42-0.82] for top versus first quintiles) and neogenin (HR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.46-0.88]) over a median 21.2-year follow-up; neogenin was also associated with ultrasound-detected asymptomatic AAA (N=4295; 57 asymptomatic AAA cases). Mendelian randomization inverse variance weighted estimates suggested that AAA risk is promoted by lower levels of kit ligand (OR per SD=0.67; P=1.4x10-5) and neogenin (OR per SD=0.50; P=0.03).

Circulating Caspase-3 has also been associated with diabetes and coronary calcium score. Here, we explored if soluble Caspase-3 (sCaspase-3) is associated with cardio-metabolic risk factors and predicts incidence of diabetes and coronary artery disease (CAD)., METHODS: Clinical data and plasma from 4637 individuals from the Malmo Diet and Cancer cohort were studied. Plasma sCaspase-3 was measured by a Proximity Extension Assay. National registers were used to identify diabetes and CAD events during follow-up. Type 2 diabetes risk variants and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for sCaspase-3 were retrieved from the DIAGRAM consortium and the Genotype-Tissue Expression project., RESULTS: HbA1c was the factor with the strongest association with sCaspase-3 (r = 0.18, P = 1.3x10-36 ). During follow-up 666 individuals developed diabetes and 648 individuals suffered from CAD. Increasing sCaspase-3 was associated with a higher risk of developing diabetes (hazard ratio (HR) 1.18 per 1unit; P = 7 x 10-5 ) and CAD (HR 1.2 per 1 unit, P = 1 x 10-4 ) during follow-up. A genetic variant rs60780116, located upstream of CASP3, showed strong association with type 2 diabetes (OR 1.06, 95%CI 1.04-1.07, P = 8.4 x 10-11 ). An eQTL was identified between this variant and gene expression of CASP3, where the allele positively correlated with type 2 diabetes was associated with increased CASP3 expression in blood., CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides evidence for plasma sCaspase-3 as a marker of cardio-metabolic risk factors and as a predictor of future diabetes and CAD in a cohort without cardiovascular disease or diabetes at baseline.

The post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression is mainly provided by microRNAs. Their remarkable stability in biological fluids and their high sensitivity to disease alteration indicates their potential role as biomarkers. Given the high mortality and morbidity of cardiovascular diseases, novel predictive biomarkers are sorely needed. Our study focuses for the first time on assessing potential biomarkers of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) based on the microRNA profiles of platelets. The study showed the overexpression of eight platelet microRNAs in ACS (miR-142-3p; miR-107; miR-338-3p, miR-223-3p, miR-21-5p, miR-130b-3p, miR-301a-3p, miR-221-3p) associated with platelet reactivity and functionality. Our results show that the combined model based on miR-142-3p and aspartate transaminase reached 82% sensitivity and 88% specificity in the differentiation of the studied groups. Furthermore, the analyzed miRNAs were shown to cluster into two orthogonal groups, regulated by two different biological factors. Bioinformatic analysis demonstrated that one group of microRNAs may be associated with the physiological processes of platelets, whereas the other group may be linked to platelet-vascular environment interactions. This analysis paves the way towards a better understanding of the role of platelet microRNAs in ACS pathophysiology and better modeling of the risk of ACS.","Authors":"Szelenberger, Rafal; Karbownik, Michal Seweryn; Kacprzak, Michal; Maciak, Karina; Bijak, Michal; Zielinska, Marzenna; Czarny, Piotr; Sliwinski, Tomasz; Saluk-Bijak, Joanna","Publisher":"Cells","Issue":"12","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cells10123526","Pages":"Not Available","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"8 platelet microRNAs"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":3,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":44,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":47,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":49,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":3589,"Title":"Cerebrovascular disease: how serum phosphorus, vitamin D, and uric acid levels contribute to the ischemic stroke","Year":2020,"Country":"","Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Associations between serum phosphorus level and the incidence of ischemic stroke are not clear. This study aimed to measure serum phosphorus, vitamin D3, and uric acid levels in ischemic stroke patients compared to a population without ischemic stroke., METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 133 patients admitted to a neurology ward with the diagnosis of ischemic stroke were compared with a control group comprising 133 age- and gender-matching individuals. The presence of ischemic stroke was confirmed by a neurologist based on clinical signs, symptoms, brain CT scan, and MRI. Blood samples were taken from all patients in the first 24 h of admission to measure serum phosphorus, vitamin D3, calcium, and uric acid levels., RESULTS: According to the results of this study, uric acid medians in patients with stroke and controls were 4.9 [3.8-6.4] and 3.9 [3.5-4.9] mg/dL, respectively (p < 0.001). Median phosphorus and vitamin D levels were significantly lower in stroke patients than the controls (3.6 [3.02-4.21] vs. 4.2 [3.8-4.6]) and (15.1 [8.2-27.9] vs. 22.7 [10.4-39.2]), respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the ischemic stroke was positively associated with the vitamin D level and negatively correlated with the uric acid level.

There are still unknowns about the role of these indicators on ischemic stroke and it requires further studies.","Authors":"Talebi, Abolfazl; Amirabadizadeh, Alireza; Nakhaee, Samaneh; Ahmadi, Zahra; Mousavi-Mirzaei, Seyed Mohammad","Publisher":"BMC neurology","Issue":"1","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12883-020-01686-4","Pages":"116","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"vitamin D3 & uric acid"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":15,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":43,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":47,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":49,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":3591,"Title":"Development of genome-wide polygenic risk scores for lipid traits and clinical applications for dyslipidemia, subclinical atherosclerosis, and diabetes cardiovascular complications among East Asians","Year":2021,"Country":"","Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The clinical utility of personal genomic information in identifying individuals at increased risks for dyslipidemia and cardiovascular diseases remains unclear., METHODS: We used data from Biobank Japan (n = 70,657-128,305) and developed novel East Asian-specific genome-wide polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for four lipid traits. We validated (n = 4271) and subsequently tested associations of these scores with 3-year lipid changes in adolescents (n = 620), carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) in adult women (n = 781), dyslipidemia (n = 7723), and coronary heart disease (CHD) (n = 2374 cases and 6246 controls) in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients., RESULTS: Our PRSs aggregating 84-549 genetic variants (0.251 < correlation coefficients (r) < 0.272) had comparably stronger association with lipid variations than the typical PRSs derived based on the genome-wide significant variants (0.089 < r < 0.240). Our PRSs were robustly associated with their corresponding lipid levels (7.5 x 10- 103 < P < 1.3 x 10- 75) and 3-year lipid changes (1.4 x 10- 6 < P < 0.0130) which started to emerge in childhood and adolescence. With the adjustments for principal components (PCs), sex, age, and body mass index, there was an elevation of 5.3% in TC (beta +/- SE = 0.052 +/- 0.002), 11.7% in TG (beta +/- SE = 0.111 +/- 0.006), 5.8% in HDL-C (beta +/- SE = 0.057 +/- 0.003), and 8.4% in LDL-C (beta +/- SE = 0.081 +/- 0.004) per one standard deviation increase in the corresponding PRS. However, their predictive power was attenuated in T2D patients (0.183 < r < 0.231). When we included each PRS (for TC, TG, and LDL-C) in addition to the clinical factors and PCs, the AUC for dyslipidemia was significantly increased by 0.032-0.057 in the general population (7.5 x 10- 3 < P < 0.0400) and 0.029-0.069 in T2D patients (2.1 x 10- 10 < P < 0.0428). Moreover, the quintile of TC-related PRS was moderately associated with cIMT in adult women (beta +/- SE = 0.011 +/- 0.005, Ptrend = 0.0182). Independent of conventional risk factors, the quintile of PRSs for TC [OR (95% CI) = 1.07 (1.03-1.11)], TG [OR (95% CI) = 1.05 (1.01-1.09)], and LDL-C [OR (95% CI) = 1.05 (1.01-1.09)] were significantly associated with increased risk of CHD in T2D patients (4.8 x 10- 4 < P < 0.0197). Further adjustment for baseline lipid drug use notably attenuated the CHD association., CONCLUSIONS: The PRSs derived and validated here highlight the potential for early genomic screening and personalized risk assessment for cardiovascular disease.","Authors":"Tam, Claudia H.

Here, we describe the derivation and validation of genomics-enhanced risk tools for two common cardiometabolic diseases, coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Data used for our analyses include the FinnGen study (N = 309,154) and the UK Biobank project (N = 343,672). The risk tools integrate contemporary genome-wide polygenic risk scores with simple questionnaire-based risk factors, including demographic, lifestyle, medication, and comorbidity data, enabling risk calculation across resources where genome data is available. Compared to routinely used clinical risk scores for coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes prevention, the risk tools show at least equivalent risk discrimination, improved risk reclassification (overall net reclassification improvements ranging from 3.7 [95% CI 2.8-4.6] up to 6.2 [4.6-7.8]), and capacity to be improved even further with standard lipid and blood pressure measurements. Without the need for blood tests or evaluation by a health professional, the risk tools provide a powerful yet simple method for preliminary cardiometabolic risk assessment for individuals with genome data available.

LASr was strongly linked to myocardial fibrosis and endocardial thickness, suggesting the utility of LASr in subclinical cardiac dysfunction detection. As CKD negatively impacts cardiovascular risk and mortality, underlying structural and functional abnormalities of cardiac remodeling are widely investigated. LASr could be used in LV diastolic dysfunction grading with an excellent discriminatory power. Our objectives were to assess the impact and existing correlations between LASr and cardiovascular outcomes, as reported in clinical trials, including patients with CKD. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for full-text papers. As reported in clinical studies, LASr was associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, including cardiovascular death and major adverse cardiovascular events (HR 0.89, 95% CI, 0.84-0.93, p < 0.01), paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (OR 0.847, 95% CI, 0.760-0.944, p = 0.003), reduced exercise capacity (AUC 0.83, 95% CI, 0.78-0.88, p < 0.01), diastolic dysfunction (p < 0.05), and estimated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (p < 0.001). Despite limitations attributed to LA deformation imaging (image quality, inter-observer variability, software necessity, learning curve), LASr constitutes a promising marker for cardiovascular events prediction and risk evaluation in patients with CKD.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

We identified lead variants across 41 loci, including genes related to cardiovascular development (HAND2, TBX20) and Mendelian forms of thoracic aortic disease (ELN, FBN1). A polygenic score significantly predicted prevalent risk of thoracic aortic aneurysm and the need for surgical intervention for patients with thoracic aneurysm across multiple ancestries within the UK Biobank, FinnGen, the Penn Medicine Biobank and the Million Veterans Program (MVP). Additionally, we highlight the primary causal role of blood pressure in reducing aortic dilation using Mendelian randomization. Overall, our findings provide a roadmap for using genetic determinants of human anatomy to understand cardiovascular development while improving prediction of diseases of the thoracic aorta.

We document near equivalent heritability of CAD across multiple ancestral groups, identify 95 novel loci, including nine on the X chromosome, detect eight loci of genome-wide significance in Black and Hispanic individuals, and demonstrate that two common haplotypes at the 9p21 locus are responsible for risk stratification in all populations except those of African origin, in which these haplotypes are virtually absent. Moreover, in the largest GWAS for angiographically derived coronary atherosclerosis performed to date, we find 15 loci of genome-wide significance that robustly overlap with established loci for clinical CAD. Phenome-wide association analyses of novel loci and polygenic risk scores (PRSs) augment signals related to insulin resistance, extend pleiotropic associations of these loci to include smoking and family history, and precisely document the markedly reduced transferability of existing PRSs to Black individuals. Downstream integrative analyses reinforce the critical roles of vascular endothelial, fibroblast, and smooth muscle cells in CAD susceptibility, but also point to a shared biology between atherosclerosis and oncogenesis.

The goal of this study was to assess if the addition of plasma lipids to traditional risk factors could improve the ability to detect and predict future AF in patients with type 2 diabetes.

To gain mech-anistic insight, follow-up lipid analysis was undertaken in a mouse model that has an insulin-resistant heart and is susceptible to AF. Sphingolipids, cholesteryl esters, and phospholipids were associated with AF prevalence, whereas two monosialodihexosylganglioside (GM3) gan-glioside species were associated with future AF. For AF detection and prediction, addition of six and three lipids, respectively, to a base model (n = 12 conventional risk factors) increased the C-statistics (detection: from 0.661 to 0.725; prediction: from 0.674 to 0.715) and cate-gorical net reclassification indices.

It is unclear whether elevated RDW contributes to, results from, or is pleiotropically related to CVDs. We used contemporary genetic techniques to probe for evidence of aetiological associations between RDW, CVDs, and CVD risk factors. Methods Using an electronic health record (EHR)-based cohort, we built and deployed a genetic risk score (GRS) for RDW to test for shared genetic architecture between RDW and the cardiovascular phenome. We also created GRSs for common CVDs (coronary artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, peripheral arterial disease, venous thromboembolism) and CVD risk factors (body mass index (BMI), low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, serum triglycerides, estimated glomerular filtration rate, diabetes mellitus) to test each for association with RDW. Significant GRS associations were further interrogated by two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR). In a separate EHR-based cohort, RDW values from 1-year pre-gastric bypass surgery and 1-2 years post-gastric bypass surgery were compared. Results In a cohort of 17 937 subjects, there were no significant associations between the RDW GRS and CVDs. Of the CVDs and CVD risk factors, only genetically predicted BMI was associated with RDW. In subsequent analyses, BMI was associated with RDW by multiple MR methods. In subjects undergoing bariatric surgery, RDW decreased postsurgery and followed a linear relationship with BMI change. Conclusions RDW is unlikely to be aetiologically upstream or downstream of CVDs or CVD risk factors except for BMI. Genetic and clinical association analyses support an aetiological relationship between BMI and RDW.Copyright ©","Authors":"Thayer, T. E.; Huang, S.; Farber-Eger, E.; Beckman, J. A.; Brittain, E.

Relationships between NT-proBNP (N-terminal Pro-B-type natriuretic peptide), systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure confirmed previous reports. Novel circulating proteins associated with blood pressure were also identified. uPA (urokinase-type plasminogen activator) was related to systolic blood pressure; ADM (adrenomedullin) was related to systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure; IL (interleukin) 16 was related to diastolic blood pressure; cFn (cellular fibronectin) and IGFBP3 (insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3) were related to pulse pressure. With the exception of IL16 and diastolic blood pressure (P=0.58), these relationships were validated in the UK Biobank (P<0.0001). Further MR analyses with cardiovascular risk factors and outcomes showed relationships between NT-proBNP and large-artery atherosclerotic stroke, IGFBP3 and diabetes mellitus as well as cFn and body mass index. Conclusion(s): We identified novel biomarkers associated with blood pressure using MR. These markers could prove useful for risk assessment and as potential therapeutic targets.Copyright © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Previous studies between heart rate variability (HRV) and cSVD revealed paradoxical results. The authors aimed to investigate the relationship between HRV and cSVD using Mendelian randomization analysis. Genetic instruments for HRV were obtained from previous genome-wide association studies. They applied inverse variance-weighted analysis, weighted median analysis, simple median analysis, and Mendelian randomization-Egger regression to evaluate the associations of HRV with white matter hyperintensity (WMH) and small vessel stroke (SVS) in the UK Biobank neuroimaging dataset and the MEGASTROKE genome-wide association study dataset. Two genetically predicted traits of HRV (the root mean square of the successive differences of inter beat intervals [RMSSD] and the peak-valley respiratory sinus arrhythmia or high frequency power [pvRSA/HF]) were suggestively associated with WMH (beta 0.26, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04-0.49, p = .02; beta 0.14, 95% CI 0.02-0.27, p = .03, respectively). Genetically predicted traits of HRV were not significantly associated with SVS. This study provides genetic support for a suggestive causal effect of HRV (RMSSD, pvRSA/HF) on WMH but not SVS.

Serum uric acid (SUA) to lymphocyte ratio (ULR), a novel inflammatory biomarker, has been considered as a better risk stratification tool of adverse outcomes than SUA or lymphocyte alone. This study aimed to investigate whether ULR produced more predictive value for stroke and explore the potential mediators of the associations. Method(s): This study enrolled 93,023 Chinese participants without stroke and myocardial infarction at baseline. Cox proportional hazard models were used to analyze the associations of ULR with stroke and subtypes. Mediation analyses were conducted to explore potential mediators of the associations. Result(s): During a median follow-up of 13.00 years, 6081 cases of incident stroke occurred, including 5048 cases of ischemic stroke (IS) and 900 cases of hemorrhagic stroke (HS). After adjustment for confounders, the Q4 group was associated with a higher risk of HS (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.03-1.50), but not with total stroke (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.03-1.13) or IS (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.97-1.12). No significant associations were found between SUA or lymphocyte and any stroke. ULR outperformed SUA or lymphocytes alone in predicting stroke. Additionally, the significant association between ULR and HS was partially mediated by systolic blood pressure (20.32%), diastolic blood pressure (11.18%) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (9.19%). Conclusion(s): ULR was significantly associated with the risk of HS, but not with IS. Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and estimated glomerular filtration rate were potential mediators for the association.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

Method(s): A total of 1072 subjects with T2DM were enrolled in this cross-sectional case-control study: 335 subjects with MI and 737 subjects without clinical signs of coronary artery disease (CAD). The genetic analysis of the rs6060566 polymorphism was performed in all subjects. To assess the degree of coronary artery obstruction, a subpopulation of 128 subjects with T2DM underwent coronary computed tomography angiography. Next, endarterectomy samples were obtained during myocardial revascularization from diffusely diseased coronary arteries in 40 cases, which were analysed for ROMO1 expression according to their genotype. Result(s): There were no statistically significant associations between different genotypes or alleles of the rs6060566 polymorphism and MI in subjects with T2DM. The carriers of the C allele of the ROMO1 rs6060566 had a threefold increased likelihood of having 50-75% coronary artery stenosis (Adjusted OR = 3.27, 95% CI 1.16-9.20). Subjects with two affected coronary arteries had a 3.72 fold higher prevalence of MI (OR = 3.72, 95% CI 1.27-10.84). With CAD in LMCA or LAD, MI prevalence was about 3.5-fold higher (p = 0.07 for LMCA and p = 0.01 for LAD). Furthermore, the carriers of the rs6060566 C allele showed higher number of positive cells for ROMO1 expression in endarterectomy samples of coronary arteries. Conclusion(s): According to our study, the rs6060566 polymorphism of the ROMO1 gene is not a risk factor for MI in Caucasians with T2DM. However, we found that subjects carrying the C allele were at a 3.27-fold increased risk of developing severe CAD compared with those who had non-obstructive CAD. Moreover, C allele carriers showed a statistically higher number of cells positive for ROMO1 compared with T allele carriers in coronary endarterectomy samples.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).","Authors":"Tibaut, M.; Mankoc Ramus, S.; Petrovic, D.","Publisher":"BMC Medical Genomics","Issue":"1","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12920-020-00845-3","Pages":"184","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"ROMO1 variant rs6060566 & C allele polymorphism & 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxygunosine (8-OHdG)"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":24,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":37,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":42,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":46,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":49,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":3650,"Title":"Pre-screening to guide coronary artery calcium scoring for early identification of high-risk individuals in the general population","Year":2022,"Country":"","Abstract":"AIMS: To evaluate the ability of Systematic COronary Risk Estimation 2 (SCORE2) and other pre-screening methods to identify individuals with high coronary artery calcium score (CACS) in the general population., METHODS AND RESULTS: Computed tomography-based CACS quantification was performed in 6530 individuals aged 45 years or older from the general population. Various pre-screening methods to guide referral for CACS were evaluated. Miss rates for high CACS (CACS >=300 and >=100) were evaluated for various pre-screening methods: moderate (>=5%) and high (>=10%) SCORE2 risk, any traditional coronary artery disease (CAD) risk factor, any Risk Or Benefit IN Screening for CArdiovascular Disease (ROBINSCA) risk factor, and moderately (>3 mg/24 h) increased urine albumin excretion (UAE).

ROBINSCA (Risk Or Benefit IN Screening for CArdiovascular disease) is a population-based randomized controlled screening trial that investigates the effectiveness of CVD screening in asymptomatic participants using the Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) model or coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring. This study describes the distributions in risk and treatment in the ROBINSCA trial., METHODS AND RESULTS: Individuals at expected elevated CVD risk were randomized into screening arm A (n = 14 478; SCORE, 10-year fatal and non-fatal risk); or screening arm B (n = 14 450; CAC scoring). Preventive treatment was largely advised according to current Dutch guidelines. Risk and treatment differences between the screening arms were analysed. A total of 12 185 participants (84.2%) in arm A and 12 950 (89.6%) in arm B were screened. In total, 48.7% were women, and median age was 62 (interquartile range 10) years. SCORE screening identified 45.1% at low risk (SCORE < 10%), 26.5% at intermediate risk (SCORE 10-20%), and 28.4% at high risk (SCORE >= 20%). According to CAC screening, 76.0% were at low risk (Agatston < 100), 15.1% at high risk (Agatston 100-399), and 8.9% at very high risk (Agatston >= 400). CAC scoring significantly reduced the number of individuals indicated for preventive treatment compared to SCORE (relative reduction women: 37.2%; men: 28.8%)., CONCLUSION: We showed that compared to risk stratification based on SCORE, CAC scoring classified significantly fewer men and women at increased risk, and less preventive treatment was indicated., TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NTR6471.

Objective(s): To determine whether there is an association between CKD and ICH risk. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): A 3-stage study that combined observational and genetic analyses was conducted. First, the association between CKD and ICH risk was tested in the Ethnic/Racial Variations of Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ERICH) study, a multicenter case-control study in the US. All participants with available data on CKD from ERICH were included. Second, this analysis was replicated in the UK Biobank (UKB), an ongoing population study in the UK. All participants in the UKB were included in this study. Third, mendelian randomization analyses were implemented in the UKB using 27 CKD-related genetic variants to test for genetic associations. ERICH was conducted from August 1, 2010, to August 1, 2017, and observed participants for 1 year. The UKB enrolled participants between 2006 and 2010 and will continue to observe them for 30 years. Data analysis was performed from November 11, 2019, to May 10, 2022. Exposures: CKD stages 1 to 5. Main Outcomes and Measures: The outcome of interest was ICH, ascertained in ERICH via expert review of neuroimages and in the UKB via a combination of self-reported data and International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, codes. Result(s): In the ERICH study, a total of 2914 participants with ICH and 2954 controls who had available data on CKD were evaluated (mean [SD] age, 61.6 [14.0] years; 2433 female participants [41.5%]; 3435 male participants [58.5%]); CKD was found to be independently associated with higher risk of ICH (odds ratio [OR], 1.95; 95% CI, 1.35-2.89; P <.001). This association was not modified by race and ethnicity. Replication in the UKB with 1341 participants with ICH and 501195 controls (mean [SD] age, 56.5 [8.1] years; 273402 female participants [54.4%]; 229134 male participants [45.6%]) confirmed this association (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.01-1.62; P =.04). Mendelian randomization analyses indicated that genetically determined CKD was associated with ICH risk (OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.13-2.16; P =.007). Conclusions and Relevance: In this 3-stage study that combined observational and genetic analyses among study participants enrolled in 2 large observational studies with different characteristics and study designs, CKD was consistently associated with higher risk of ICH. Mendelian randomization analyses suggest that this association was causal. Further studies are needed to identify the specific biological pathways that mediate this association..Copyright © 2022 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.","Authors":"Vanent, K.

This study evaluated epicardial fat volume (EFV), adipokines, coronary atherosclerosis, and adverse cardiovascular events in a cohort of asymptomatic patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Epicardial fat volume was calculated using data from computed tomography coronary angiograms. Adipokines and inflammatory cytokines were also assayed and correlated with EFV. Epicardial fat volume was also assessed as a predictor of coronary artery calcium (CAC) score, number of coronary artery plaques, and significant plaque (>50% luminal stenosis). Data from the EFV analysis were available for 221 (85.7%) participants. Median EFV was 97.4 cm3, mean body mass index was 28.1 kg/m2, and mean duration of T2DM was 13 years. Statistically significant, but weak, correlations were observed between several adipokines, inflammatory cytokines, and EFV. Epicardial fat volume was a significant univariate (P = .01), but not multivariate, predictor of the number of coronary plaques, but not of CAC score or significant plaque. After a mean follow-up of 22.8 months, 12 adverse cardiovascular events were reported, exclusively in participants with EFV >97.4 cm3. Epicardial fat volume has limited utility as a marker of coronary artery plaque in patients with T2DM and is weakly correlated with adipokine expression.","Authors":"Venuraju, Shreenidhi M.; Lahiri, Avijit; Jeevarethinam, Anand; Rakhit, Roby D.; Shah, Prediman K.; Nilsson, Jan","Publisher":"Angiology","Issue":"5","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0003319720984607","Pages":"442-450","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"epicardial fat volume"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":3,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":28,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":43,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":47,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":49,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":3778,"Title":"Anti-Mullerian Hormone and Cardiometabolic Disease in Women: A Two-Sample Mendelian Randomization Study","Year":2022,"Country":"","Abstract":"Background: Higher age-specific circulating anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels have been linked to a lower risk of cardiometabolic outcomes. However, whether AMH has a casual role in the etiology of these diseases is unknown. The objective of this study was therefore to explore if circulating AMH levels have a causal effect on risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), ischemic stroke and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in women, using a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach. Method(s): We used four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the most recent AMH GWAS meta-analysis as instrumental variables. Summary-level data for CAD (n = 149,752; 11,802 cases), ischemic stroke (n = 17,541; 4678 cases) and T2D (n = 464,389; 30,052 cases) were extracted from the UK Biobank, the Stroke Genetics Network, and DIAMANTE consortia, respectively. To assess the presence of potential pleiotropy we tested the association of the four AMH SNPs, both individually and combined in a weighted genetic risk score, with a range of cardiovascular risk factors and intermediate traits using UK Biobank data. Result(s): MR estimates, i.e., inverse variance-weighted odds ratios (ORIVW), did not support a causal effect of circulating AMH levels on CAD (ORIVW = 1.13, 95% CI: 0.95-1.35), ischemic stroke (ORIVW = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.83-1.49), and T2D (ORIVW = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.87-1.10). After adjustment for multiple testing, we observed associations between genetically predicted AMH and age at menopause, and age at menarche, but not with intermediate traits on the causal pathway between AMH and cardiometabolic health, such as atherosclerosis or glucose levels. Conclusion(s): This study does not provide evidence for a causal effect of circulating AMH levels on CAD, ischemic stroke and T2D in women, although weak instrument bias cannot be excluded.Copyright: © 2022 The Author(s).","Authors":"Verdiesen, R.

Electrical phenotypes are common in genetic DCM, but their exact contribution to the clinical course and outcome is unknown. We determined the prevalence of pathogenic gene variants in a large unselected DCM population and determined the role of electrical phenotypes in association with outcome. Method(s): This study included 689 patients with DCM from the Maastricht Cardiomyopathy Registry, undergoing genetic evaluation using a 48 cardiomyopathy-associated gene-panel, echocardiography, endomyocardial biopsies, and Holter monitoring. Upon detection of a pathogenic variant in a patient with DCM, familial segregation was performed. Outcome was defined as cardiovascular death, heart transplantation, heart failure hospitalization, and/or occurrence of life-threatening arrhythmias. Result(s): A (likely) pathogenic gene variant was found in 19% of patients, varying from 36% in familial to 13% in nonfamilial DCM. Family segregation analysis showed familial disease in 46% of patients with DCM who were initially deemed nonfamilial by history. Overall, 18% of patients with a nongenetic risk factor had a pathogenic gene variant. Almost all pathogenic gene variants occurred in just 12 genes previously shown to have robust disease association with DCM. Genetic DCM was independently associated with electrical phenotypes such as atrial fibrillation, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, and atrioventricular block and inversely correlated with the presence of a left bundle branch block (P<0.01). After a median follow-up of 4 years, event-free survival was reduced in genetic versus patients with nongenetic DCM (P=0.01). This effect on outcome was mediated by the associated electrical phenotypes of genetic DCM (P<0.001). Conclusion(s): One in 5 patients with an established nongenetic risk factor or a nonfamilial disease still carries a pathogenic gene variant. Genetic DCM is characterized by a profile of electrical phenotypes (atrial fibrillation, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, and atrioventricular block), which carries increased risk for adverse outcomes. Based on these findings, we envisage a broader role for genetic testing in DCM.Copyright © 2020 American Heart Association, Inc.","Authors":"Verdonschot, J. A. J.; Hazebroek, M. R.; Krapels, I. P.

The effect of sex on aneurysm development has been associated with the effects of sex hormones through mechanisms that are not fully understood. The present study examined the association between the levels of sex hormones and the occurrence of AAAs in elderly men., METHODS: A prospective case-control study was conducted of 452 men aged 65 years participating in screening for AAAs from 2013 to 2019. Of the 452 men, 230 had an AAA and 222 an aortic diameter of <30 mm (control group). Questionnaires and blood samples were collected and stored consecutively. The serum levels of total testosterone, estradiol, progesterone, luteinizing hormone, and sex hormone-binding globulin were analyzed using electrochemiluminescent immunoassays. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between sex hormones and AAA., RESULTS: The median aneurysm diameter was 33 mm. Men with AAA had greater estradiol (93 pmol/L vs 84 pmol/L; P =.003) and progesterone (0.41 nmol/L vs 0.17 nmol/L; P < .001) levels compared with the controls. The testosterone levels were lower in the AAA group than in the control group (13 nmol/L vs 14 nmol/L; P = .026). AAA was associated with detectable levels of progesterone (odds ratio [OR], 6.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.86-11.47), smoking (OR, 5.26; 95% CI, 3.12-8.85), coronary heart disease (OR, 4.06; 95% CI, 1.92-8.58), and a body mass index >25 kg/m2 (OR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.34-3.82)., CONCLUSIONS: The observed higher estradiol and progesterone levels in men with an AAA suggest an effect of sex hormones on aneurysm development. The association between progesterone levels and the aortic diameter stresses the importance of focusing on the potential effect of this unconsidered female sex hormone on aneurysm formation.

Such calculators did not include chronic kidney disease (CKD)-based biomarker called estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The novelty of this study is to design and develop an advanced integrated version called-AECRS2.0 that combines eGFR with image phenotypes to compute the composite risk score. Furthermore, AECRS2.0 was benchmarked against QRISK3 which considers eGFR for risk assessment. Method(s): The method consists of three major steps: 1) five, current CUS image phenotypes (CUSIP) measurements using AtheroEdge system (AtheroPoint, CA, USA) consisting of: average carotid intima-media thickness (cIMTave), maximum cIMT (cIMTmax), minimum cIMT (cIMTmin), variability in cIMT (cIMTV), and total plaque area (TPA); 2) five, 10-year CUSIP measurements by combining these current five CUSIP with 11 CCVRF (age, ethnicity, gender, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, smoking, carotid artery type, hemoglobin, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, and eGFR); 3) AECRS2.0 risk score computation and its comparison to QRISK3 using area-under-the-curve (AUC). Result(s): South Asian-Indian 339 patients were retrospectively analyzed by acquiring their left/right common carotid arteries (678 CUS, mean age: 54.25+/-9.84 years; 75.22% males; 93.51% diabetic with HbA1c >=6.5%; and mean eGFR 73.84+/-20.91 mL/min/1.73m2). The proposed AECRS2.0 reported higher AUC (AUC=0.89, P<0.001) compared to QRISK3 (AUC=0.51, P<0.001) by ~74% in CKD patients.

However, the human heart is a complex structure with significant uncharacterized phenotypic variation beyond traditional metrics of size and function. Characterizing variation in cardiac shape and morphology can add to our ability to understand and classify cardiovascular risk and pathophysiology. We describe deep learning enabled measurement of left ventricle (LV) sphericity using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging data from the UK Biobank and show that among adults with normal LV volumes and systolic function, increased sphericity is associated with increased risk for incident atrial fibrillation (HR 1.31 per SD, 95% CI 1.23-1.38), cardiomyopathy (HR 1.62 per SD, 95% CI 1.29-2.02), and heart failure (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.11-1.39), independent of traditional risk factors including age, sex, hypertension, and body mass index. Using genome-wide association studies, we identify four loci associated with sphericity at genome-wide significance. These loci harbor known and suspected cardiomyopathy genes. Through genetic correlation and Mendelian randomization, we provide evidence that sphericity may represent a subclinical manifestation of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Objective(s): We investigated the associations of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations and genetic factors with risks of total and subtypes of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D), among whom vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency is particularly common. Method(s): This prospective study included 15,103 individuals with T2D who were initially free of CVD and had serum 25(OH)D measurements in the UK Biobank. Incidences of total and subtypes of CVD, including ischemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke, were ascertained via electronic health records. Weighted genetic risk scores (GRSs) were constructed for IHD and stroke. Result(s): The mean serum 25(OH)D concentration was 43.4 nmol/L (SD: 20.4 nmol/L), and 65.7% of participants had a vitamin D concentration below 50 nmol/L. During a median of 11.2 years of follow-up, 3534 incident CVD events were documented. Compared with individuals with 25(OH)D concentrations <25 nmol/L, participants with 25(OH)D concentrations >=75 nmol/L had HRs (95% CIs) of 0.75 (0.64, 0.88) for CVD, 0.69 (0.56, 0.84) for IHD, and 0.74 (0.52, 1.06) for stroke. Participants with 25(OH)D concentrations >=50 nmol/L and low GRSs, as compared with individuals with 25(OH)D concentrations <25 nmol/L and high GRSs, had a 50% (39%, 65%) lower risk of IHD. No significant interactions were demonstrated between serum 25(OH)D concentrations and the GRSs and genetic variants in vitamin D receptors (VDR). Conclusion(s): Higher serum 25(OH)D concentrations were significantly associated with lower risks of total CVD and IHD among patients with T2D, regardless of their genetic susceptibility and the genetic variants in VDR. Risk reductions tended to plateau at serum 25(OH)D levels around 50 nmol/L. These findings suggest that maintaining an adequate vitamin D status and avoiding deficiency may help to prevent CVD complications among patients with T2D.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

Proteinuria is often detected in patients with diabetes mellitus. The present study was designed to evaluate the association between time-dependent proteinuria and the risk of stroke in a patient cohort with different glucose tolerance status. Methods and Results A total of 82 938 participants, who were free of myocardial infarction or stroke and underwent fasting blood glucose and urinary protein measurements at baseline in the Kailuan study, were enrolled. Proteinuria was determined using urine dipstick tests at baseline and subsequent follow-ups. Time-dependent proteinuria was defined as the status of urine protein updated through the follow-up examinations, separately. Time-dependent Cox regression models were used to analyze the relationship between time-dependent proteinuria and the risk of stroke. During a median follow-up of 8.37 years, 2538 participants developed stroke. After adjusting for confounding factors, the hazard ratio (95% CI) for stroke in time-dependent proteinuria among all participants, and the normoglycemia, prediabetes, and diabetes mellitus populations were 1.68 (1.49-1.89), 1.73 (1.47-2.05), 2.15 (1.70-2.72), and 1.30 (1.03-1.65), respectively.

There were no associations between any BoAA and cancer., INTERPRETATION: From the public health perspective, GrimAgeAccel is the most useful tool for identifying at-risk elderly, and evaluating the efficacy of anti-aging interventions., FUNDING: National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences of U.S., Harvard Chan-NIEHS Center for Environmental Health, German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, and the State of Bavaria in Germany.

This study also examined the influence of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites on the susceptibility of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) using meta-analysis and intended to provide additional information on pathogenesis of AAA research. Method(s): Electronic databases including PubMed and Web of Science were systemically searched to collect the information on AAA, inflammatory factors such as CRP, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha and the SNP sites for data extraction. Altogether six SNPs in four genes (rs3091244, CRP; rs1800947, CRP; rs1205, CRP; rs1800795, IL-6; rs1800896, IL-10; and rs1800629, TNF) were assessed. Result(s): This study enrolled altogether 41 relevant investigations involving 9,007 AAA patients to carry out meta-analysis. According to pooled analysis, circulating CRP and IL-6 levels were shown to be related to the AAA, while plasma IL-10 and TNF-alpha levels were not associated with AAA. The circulating CRP level standard mean difference (SMD) was 0.30 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.17-0.43), the IL-6 level SMD was 0.34 (95% CI: 0.20-0.49), the IL-10 level SMD was -0.01 (95% CI: -0.09-0.06), and the TNF-alpha level SMD was 0.09 (95% CI: 0.00-0.19). Similarly, the odds ratio (OR) of rs3091244 (CRP) under the recessive gene model was 1.70 (95% CI: 1.13-2.57). In addition, individuals with A and T mutant genes at locus rs3091244 might have a higher tendency of AAA susceptibility than those with C allele. Consecutively, the OR was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.51-0.97) for rs1800795 (IL-6) locus in the allele model, and individuals with G mutant gene at locus rs1800795 (IL-6) might be less susceptible to AAA than those with C allele. Meanwhile, the rs1800896 (IL-10) locus had a positive association under the five statistical models, and individuals with A mutant gene at locus rs1800896 might have a higher susceptibility to AAA than those with G allele. Nevertheless, the rs1800947 (CRP), rs1205 (CRP), and rs1800629 (TNF) loci did not have positive correlation under the five statistical models, with no statistical significance. The results indicate that the gene polymorphisms at rs1800629, rs1800947, and rs1205 loci were not related to the AAA susceptibility. Conclusion(s): Gene polymorphisms in certain known inflammatory mediators related to AAA susceptibility might serve as potential predictive biomarkers for clinical applications. Moreover, SNP of inflammatory mediators relevant to abdominal aortic aneurysmal formation and progression need extensive investigations to confirm these results.Copyright: © 2022 The Author(s).","Authors":"Wang, H.; Zhong, Z.; Jiang, D.; Zhang, H.; Yin, F.; Guo, P.; Chen, J.; Zhu, X.; You, K.; Han, Y.; Liu, K.","Publisher":"Reviews in Cardiovascular Medicine","Issue":"8","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.31083/j.rcm2308270","Pages":"270","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"levels of circulating inflammatory factors CRP & IL-6 & IL-10 & TNF-alpha & associated SNPs"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":7,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":3,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":18,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":28,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":42,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":47,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":58,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":3859,"Title":"Assessment of causal direction between thyroid function and cardiometabolic health: a Mendelian randomization study","Year":2022,"Country":"","Abstract":"BACKGROUND Growing evidence have demonstrated that thyroid hormones have been involved in the processes of cardiovascular metabolism. However, the causal relationship of thyroid function and cardiometabolic health remains partly unknown. METHODS The Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to test genetic, potentially causal relationships between instrumental variables and cardiometabolic traits. Genetic variants of free thyroxine (FT4) and thyrotropin (TSH) levels within the reference range were used as instrumental variables. Data for genetic associations with cardiometabolic diseases were acquired from the genome-wide association studies of the FinnGen, CARDIoGRAM and CARDIoGRAMplusC4D, CHARGE, and MEGASTROKE. This study was conducted using summary statistic data from large, previously described cohorts. Association between thyroid function and essential hypertension (EHTN), secondary hypertension (SHTN), hyperlipidemia (HPL), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), ischemic heart disease (IHD), myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), pulmonary heart disease (PHD), stroke, and non-rheumatic valve disease (NRVD) were examined. RESULTS Genetically predicted FT4 levels were associated with SHTN (odds ratio = 0.48; 95% CI = 0.04-0.82, P = 0.027), HPL (odds ratio = 0.67; 95% CI = 0.18-0.88, P = 0.023), T2DM (odds ratio = 0.80; 95% CI = 0.42-0.86, P = 0.005), IHD (odds ratio = 0.85; 95% CI = 0.49-0.98, P = 0.039), NRVD (odds ratio = 0.75; 95% CI = 0.27-0.97, P = 0.039). Additionally, genetically predicted TSH levels were associated with HF (odds ratio = 0.82; 95% CI = 0.68-0.99, P = 0.042), PHD (odds ratio = 0.75; 95% CI = 0.32-0.82, P = 0.006), stroke (odds ratio = 0.95; 95% CI = 0.81-0.97, P = 0.007). However, genetically predicted thyroid function traits were not associated with EHTN and MI. CONCLUSIONS Our study suggests FT4 and TSH are associated with cardiometabolic diseases, underscoring the importance of the pituitary-thyroid-cardiac axis in cardiometabolic health susceptibility.Copyright © 2022 JGC All rights reserved","Authors":"Wang, J.

It is not known how continuous TDI curves change with age in normal subjects, and whether these changes differ from changes seen in individuals at risk of future cardiac events. Method(s): A total of 1,763 individuals from the general population were examined with color TDI at the septal and lateral mitral sites. A low-risk group was defined as without cardiac risk factors (hypertension, diabetes or ischemic heart disease) at baseline and without any cardiac events (cardiovascular death or admission due to either heart failure or acute myocardial infarction) during 10-years follow-up. All TDI curves were corrected for heart rate, and whole-cycle analysis of age-related changes to TDI velocities was performed in both low-risk (n = 881) and high-risk individuals (n = 882). Result(s): In the low-risk population, four phases where myocardial velocity differed most (p < 10-10) according to age were identified [in a standardized cardiac cycle of 1 second (s)]: Systolic peak (0.09-0.13 s), systolic plateau (0.18-0.27 s), early diastole (0.43-0.54 s) and late diastole (0.88-0.95 s). With increasing age, systolic velocities decreased, early diastolic velocities decreased and had delayed peak, and late diastolic velocities increased until age 70 and then stopped increasing. In the high-risk population, comparison to corresponding age groups of the low-risk population showed: Lower early diastolic velocities in 20-40-year-olds; higher late diastolic velocities and lower peak systolic velocities in 40-60-year-olds; further decreased systolic velocities including the systolic plateau and decreased late diastolic velocities in 60-year-olds. The time segments around the systolic peak (p = 0.002) and early diastole (p < 0.001) differed significantly between the high-risk and low-risk population, thus making it possible to use the individual age gap between a TDI-derived biological age and the real chronological age as a tool to discriminate high-risk individuals from low-risk individuals. Conclusion(s): We found that individuals with cardiac risk factors display findings compatible with an accelerated aging of the heart and thus propose TDI-derived biological age as a tool to identify high-risk patients.Copyright © 2023 Wang, Olsen, Taraldsen and Mogelvang.","Authors":"Wang, J.

This is the first multi-ethnic population-based study to use these serum biomarkers for preventive strategy. No association was found between RANTES, EMMPRIN, MMP2, and MMP9 with CVD. What is the implication of the main findings? Our research improves the understanding of inflammatory biomarkers in the cardiovascular field. Currently, these biomarkers are ineffective for risk stratification or diagnosis when used as a single indicator. Prevention of CVD still requires a comprehensive evaluation of CVD risk factors. Background(s): The growing cardiovascular disease (CVD) epidemic calls for further research to identify novel biomarkers for earlier detection and as potential therapeutic targets. Biomarkers Regulated on Activation, Normal T Cell Expressed and Secreted (RANTES), extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2, and MMP-9) are linked to proatherogenic and proinflammatory pathways of CVD development, the majority of which are coronary artery disease (CAD) and stroke. We evaluated potential factors affecting these four biomarkers and established their association with CVD. Method(s): This is a cross-sectional analysis using a nested case-control design involving 580 participants aged 21-75 years from the prospective multi-ethnic cohort study. A total of 290 CVD cases and 290 age-and sex-matched controls were identified. All participants underwent interviews, health screenings, and provided blood samples, including biomarkers RANTES, EMMPRIN, and MMPs. CVD was defined based on previous medical history. Result(s): The average age of the participants was 55.7(SD = 10.3) years of age, and 34.6% were female. Arrhythmia history and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels were significant factors of logEMMPRIN (beta = -0.124 [-0.245, -0.003] and beta = 0.111 [0.0, 0.191], respectively). Only female sex (beta = 0.189 [0.078, 0.300]) for logRANTES and age (beta = 0.033 [0.010, 0.055]) for logMMP-2 and logMMP-9 were significant. The Indian ethnicity (beta = 0.192 [0.048, 0.335]) and highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels (beta = 0.063 [0.011, 0.116]) were statistically significant for logMMP-9. No association was detected between biomarkers and CVD. Conclusion(s): In this multi-ethnic study cohort, RANTES was associated with sex, EMMPRIN was associated with a history of arrhythmia and LDL levels, MMP-2 with age, and MMP-9 with ethnicity and hs-CRP levels.

Genetic risk of CHD and stroke was estimated using polygenic risk scores derived from 300 and 87 single-nucleotide polymorphisms, respectively. Lifestyle scores were calculated based on 4 lifestyle components (no obesity, no current smoking, regular physical activity and healthy diet). Cox regression with age as the underlying timescale was fit for incident CHD (n = 7470) and stroke (n = 5015), separately. A favourable lifestyle (3-4 lifestyle components) was associated with 37% and 30% lower hazards of CHD (95% confidence intervals, 32-42%) and stroke (23-37%), compared with an unfavourable lifestyle (0-1 lifestyle component), at all levels of genetic risk. Evidence of interaction between genetic susceptibility and lifestyle adherence was found for stroke (P = 0.036): no evidence of interaction for CHD (P = 0.524). A favourable lifestyle at high genetic risk had lower 12-year absolute risk of CHD and stroke, compared with an unfavourable lifestyle at low-to-intermediate genetic (exception: an unfavourable lifestyle at low CHD genetic risk)., CONCLUSION: Adhering to a healthy lifestyle is associated with lower CHD and stroke risk regardless of genetic risk among individuals with hypertension. Risk of CHD and stroke for those at high genetic risk but adhering to a healthy lifestyle was generally lower than for those at low-to-intermediate genetic risk but adhering to an unhealthy lifestyle.

This study aimed to determine whether TNFRSF11B polymorphisms are associated with prognosis of large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) stroke. Three TNFRSF11B polymorphisms (rs2073617, rs2073618 and rs3134069) were genotyped in 1010 patients with LAA stroke. Short-term outcome was evaluated using the modified Rankin Scale score at 3-month after stroke onset. Long-term outcome was assessed using the stroke recurrence. We found that rs2073617G was associated with an increased risk of poor outcome of LAA stroke (additive model: odds ratio (OR) = 1.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.06-1.73). This association was also observed in rs3134069C (additive model: OR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.10-2.12). Furthermore, when we combined these two polymorphisms according to the numbers of risk alleles (rs2073617G and rs3134069C), we found that the patients with 3-4 risk alleles were statistically significantly associated with an increased risk of poor outcome of LAA stroke (OR = 1.90, 95% CI = 1.10-3.28) compared with 0-2 risk alleles, and this increased risk was more evident among those with hypertension (OR = 2.02, 95% CI = 1.04-3.91), those without diabetes (OR = 2.02, 95% CI = 1.02-4.01) and those with smoking (OR = 2.43, 95% CI = 1.09-5.42). In silico analysis showed that rs2073617 and rs3134069 are located in various histone modification marked regions, DNase I hypersensitive sites and can change the binding of regulatory motifs. Moreover, rs2073617 is also located in the binding site of transcription factors.

We hypothesized that there may be a genetic basis for ECG-AI based risk estimates. We applied an ECG-AI model for predicting incident AF to ECGs from 39,986 UK Biobank participants without AF. We then performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of the predicted AF risk. We identified three signals (P<5x10-8) at established AF susceptibility loci marked by the sarcomeric gene TTN, and sodium channel genes SCN5A and SCN10A. We also identified two novel loci near the genes VGLL2 and EXT1. In contrast, a GWAS of risk estimates from a clinical variable model indicated a different genetic profile. Predicted AF risk from an ECG-AI model is influenced by genetic variation implicating sarcomeric, ion channel, and height pathways.

Here, we explored the associations of mtDNA 8-OHdG in leukocytes with obstructive CAD, coronary stenosis severity, cardiovascular biomarkers, and 1-year adverse outcomes after coronary revascularization in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)., METHODS: In a total of 1920 consecutive patients with T2DM who underwent coronary angiography due to symptoms of angina or angina equivalents, the presence of obstructive CAD, the number of diseased vessels with >= 50% stenosis, and modified Gensini score were cross-sectionally evaluated; the level of mtDNA 8-OHdG was quantified by quantitative PCR. Then, 701 of 1920 diabetic patients who further received coronary revascularization completed 1-year prospective follow-up to document major adverse cardiovascular and cerebral events (MACCEs). In vitro experiments were also performed to observe the effects of mtDNA oxidative damage in high glucose-cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)., RESULTS: Cross-sectionally, greater mtDNA 8-OHdG was associated with increased odds of obstructive CAD (odds ratio [OR] 1.38, 95% CI confidence interval 1.24-1.52), higher degree of coronary stenosis (number of diseased vessels: OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.19-1.41; modified Gensini scores: OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.18-1.39), and higher levels of C-reactive protein (beta 0.18, 95% CI 0.06-0.31) after adjusting for confounders. Sensitivity analyses using propensity score matching yielded similar results. Stratification by smoking status showed that the association between mtDNA 8-OHdG and obstructive CAD was most evident in current smokers (Pinteration < 0.01). Prospectively, the adjusted hazards ratio per 1-SD increase in mtDNA 8-OHdG was 1.59 (95% CI 1.33-1.90) for predicting 1-year MACCEs after revascularization. In HUVECs, exposure to antimycin A, an inducer for mtDNA oxidative damage, led to adverse alterations in markers of mitochondrial and endothelia function., CONCLUSION: Greater mtDNA 8-OHdG in leukocytes may serve as an independent risk factor for CAD in patients with T2DM.","Authors":"Wang, Xue-Bin; Cui, Ning-Hua; Liu, Xia'nan; Liu, Xin","Publisher":"Cardiovascular diabetology","Issue":"1","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12933-020-00998-6","Pages":"22","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"mitochondrial DNA 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (mtDNA 8-OHdG)"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":40,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":47,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":58,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":3914,"Title":"Significant association between rs28362491 polymorphism in NF-kappaB1 gene and coronary artery disease: a meta-analysis","Year":2020,"Country":"","Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The association of rs28362491 polymorphism in NF-kappaB1 gene and coronary artery disease (CAD) risk was reported in several studies with inconsistent outcomes.

However, these studies were generally performed for single-trait and failed to consider the pleiotropic effects of these risk genes among the multiple risk factors for stroke. In this study, we applied a novel metaCCA method followed by gene-based VEGAS2 analysis to identify the risk genes for stroke that may overlap between seven correlated risk factors (including atrial fibrillation, hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, diabetes, body mass index, and total cholesterol level) by integrating seven corresponding GWAS data. We detected 20 potential pleiotropic genes that may be associated with multiple risk factors of stroke. Furthermore, using gene-to-trait pathway analysis, we suggested six potential risk genes (FUT8, GMIP, PLA2G6, PDE3A, SMARCA4, SKAPT) that may affect ischemic or hemorrhage stroke through multiple intermediate factors such as MAPK family. These findings provide novel insight into the genetic determinants contributing to the concurrent development of biological conditions that may influence stroke susceptibility, and also indicate some potential therapeutic targets that can be further studied for the prevention of cerebrovascular disease.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Authors":"Wang, Z.; Greenbaum, J.; Qiu, C.; Li, K.; Wang, Q.; Tang, S.

To verify and implement this idea, we have selected a total of 165 patients with T2DM treated in our hospital from March 2019 to October 2021 that were divided into CHD group (n = 72) and non-CHD group (n = 93) according to the results of coronary angiography. Patients with CHD were divided into three groups according to SYNTAX score: low-risk group, medium-risk group, and high-risk group. The clinical data of all patients were collected. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to screen the risk factors of CHD in patients with T2DM. The related inflammatory factors such as C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and water-soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L) were detected in all patients. Pearson's linear correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation between the expression levels of CRP, IL-6, and sCD40L and CHD in patients with T2DM. The receiver working curve (ROC) was used to evaluate the efficacy of IL-6, CRP, and sCD40L in predicting high risk of CHD in patients with T2DM. Multivariate analysis showed that age and course of T2DM, FFA, UA, and Hcy were risk factors for CHD in patients with T2DM. The serum levels of IL-6, CRP, and sCD40L in patients with CHD were significantly higher than those in patients without CHD. According to SYNTAX score, 72 patients with CHD were divided into low-risk group (n = 36), medium-risk group (n = 26), and high-risk group (n = 10). Compared with the low-risk group, the expression levels of serum IL-6 CRP and sCD40L in the middle-risk group and high-risk group were significantly higher than those in the low-risk group. The expression levels of IL-6 CRP and sCD40L in the high-risk group were also significantly higher than those in the medium-risk group. There is a positive correlation between syntactic score and IL-6 expression in patients with T2DM complicated with coronary heart disease (r = 0.778, P < 0.001), with the expression of CRP (r = 0.756, P < 0.001) and with the expression of sCD40L (r = 0.748, P < 0.001). Advanced age, long course of T2DM, elevated levels of FFA, UA, and Hcy are all risk factors of CHD in patients with type 2 diabetes. T2DM patients with the above risk factors should be vigilant and pay attention to monitoring the related indexes of coronary heart disease to avoid the occurrence of serious cardiovascular disease. CRP, IL-6, and sCD40L are involved in the progression of CHD in patients with T2DM. The more severe CHD is, the higher the expression of IL-6, CRP, and sCD40L in serum.

Progression to heart failure is usually preceded by ventricular dysfunction, linked to matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) mediated extracellular matrix changes. We hypothesise that the minor allele of genetic variant rs3918242 in the promoter region of the MMP-9 gene is associated with hypertension and/or myocardial infarction, with resultant progression of dysfunctional cardiac remodelling in patients with diabetes without symptomatic heart failure., METHODS: We genotyped 498 diabetes patients participating in the St Vincent's Screening TO Prevent Heart Failure (STOP-HF) follow-up programme for the rs3918242 single nucleotide polymorphism and investigated associations with the co-primary endpoints hypertension and/or myocardial infarction using a dominant model. We also evaluated resulting cardiometabolic phenotype and progression of ventricular dysfunction and cardiac structural abnormalities over a median follow-up period of 3.5 years., RESULTS: The CT/TT genotype comprised 28.1% of the cohort and was associated with a twofold higher risk of myocardial infarction (17.9% vs 8.4%), a reduction in ejection fraction and greater left ventricular systolic dysfunction progression [adjusted OR = 2.56 (1.09, 6.01), p = 0.026] over a median follow-up of 3.5 years [IQR 2.6, 4.9 years]. Conversely, rs3918242 was not associated with hypertension, blood pressure, pulse pressure or left ventricular mass index at baseline or over follow up., CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes patients with the minor T allele of rs3918242 in the STOP-HF follow up programme have greater risk of myocardial infarction, lower ejection fraction and greater progression of left ventricular systolic abnormalities, a precursor to heart failure. These data may support further work on MMP-9 as a biomarker of ventricular dysfunction and the investigation of MMP-9 inhibitors for heart failure prevention in diabetes, particularly in the post-infarction setting.

Legumain is related to carotid atherosclerotic plaques and may be a new biomarker of carotid atherosclerosis. However, the association between legumain and peripheral artery disease (PAD) of lower extremity has been less studied. This study is aimed at exploring the potential link between legumain and PAD in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 483 hospitalized T2DM patients. The serum legumain level was measured by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. PAD was evaluated by color Doppler sonography. The association between legumain and PAD was tested by logistic regression. The predictive power of legumain for PAD was evaluated with the receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve. Results. Overall, 201 (41.6%) patients suffered from PAD. Patients with PAD had significantly higher serum legumain level than those without PAD [11.9 (6.3, 17.9) mug/L vs. 7.6 (3.2, 14.2) mug/L, p<0.001]. Logistic regression showed that a higher serum legumain level was independently associated with a greater risk of PAD in T2DM patients [adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.03; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01-1.06].

Components of the AAA risk score were age (stratified by smoking status), weight (stratified by smoking status), antihypertensive and cholesterol-lowering medication use, height, diastolic blood pressure, baseline cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. In the validation cohort, over 10 years of follow-up, the C-index for the model of the USPSTF guidelines was 0.705 (95% CI, 0.678-0.733). The C-index of the risk score as a continuous variable was 0.856 (95% CI, 0.837-0.878). In the validation cohort, the USPSTF model yielded sensitivity 63.9% and specificity 71.3%. At the 0.25% 10-year risk threshold, the risk score yielded sensitivity 82.1% and specificity 70.7% while also improving the net reclassification index compared with the USPSTF model +0.176 (95% CI, 0.120-0.232). A combined model, whereby risk scoring was combined with the USPSTF model, also improved prediction compared with USPSTF alone (net reclassification index +0.101 [95% CI, 0.055-0.147])., CONCLUSIONS: In an asymptomatic general population, a risk score based on patient age, height, weight, and medical history may improve identification of asymptomatic patients at risk for clinical events from AAA. Further development and validation of risk scores to detect asymptomatic AAA are needed.","Authors":"Welsh, Paul; Welsh, Claire E.; Jhund, Pardeep S.; Woodward, Mark; Brown, Rosemary; Lewsey, Jim; Celis-Morales, Carlos A.; Ho, Frederick K.; MacKay, Daniel F.; Gill, Jason M.

Less is known about whether the increased risk persists long-term or is independent of renal function and other important biomarkers. Methods and Results Cystatin C and other biomarkers were measured at baseline (in 7863 patients) and 1 year later (in 6106 patients) in participants in the LIPID (Long-Term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischemic Disease) study, who had a previous acute coronary syndrome. Outcomes were ascertained during the study (median follow-up, 6 years) and long-term (median follow-up, 16 years). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated using Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equations (first GFR-creatinine, then GFR-creatinine-cystatin C). Over 6 years, in fully adjusted multivariable time-to-event models, with respect to the primary end point of coronary heart disease mortality or nonfatal myocardial infarction, for comparison of Quartile 4 versus 1 of baseline cystatin C, the hazard ratio was 1.37 (95% CI, 1.07-1.74; P=0.01), and for major cardiovascular events was 1.47 (95% CI, 1.19-1.82; P<0.001). Over 16 years, the association of baseline cystatin C with coronary heart disease, cardiovascular, and all-cause mortality persisted (each P<0.001) and remained significant after adjustment for estimated GFR-creatinine-cystatin C. Cystatin C also predicted the development of chronic kidney disease for 6 years (odds ratio, 6.61; 95% CI, 4.28-10.20) independently of estimated GFR-creatinine and other risk factors. However, this association was no longer significant after adjustment for estimated GFR-creatinine-cystatin C. Conclusions Cystatin C independently predicted major cardiovascular events, development of chronic kidney disease, and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Prediction of long-term mortality was independent of improved estimation of GFR.

Objective(s): We sought to leverage the multistudy setup of the Women's Health Initiative cohort to generate and test genetic scores for the response of 6 CRFs (BMI, systolic blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and fasting glucose) to dietary fat. Method(s): A genome-wide interaction study was undertaken for each CRF in women (n ~9000) not participating in the dietary modification (DM) trial, which focused on the reduction of dietary fat. Genetic scores based on these analyses were developed using a pruning-and-thresholding approach and tested for the prediction of 1-y CRF changes as well as long-term chronic disease development in DM trial participants (n ~5000). Result(s): Only 1 of these genetic scores, for LDL cholesterol, predicted changes in the associated CRF. This 1760-variant score explained 3.7% (95% CI: 0.09, 11.9) of the variance in 1-y LDL cholesterol changes in the intervention arm but was unassociated with changes in the control arm. In contrast, a main-effect genetic risk score for LDL cholesterol was not useful for predicting dietary fat response. Further investigation of this score with respect to downstream disease outcomes revealed suggestive differential associations across DM trial arms, especially with respect to coronary heart disease and stroke subtypes. Conclusion(s): These results lay the foundation for the combination of many genome-wide gene-diet interactions for diet response prediction while highlighting the need for further research and larger samples in order to achieve robust biomarkers for use in personalized nutrition.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.","Authors":"Westerman, K.; Liu, Q.; Liu, S.; Parnell, L.

The primary outcome was a combined CVD end point defined as myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization procedures, or fatal CVD.

Over an average follow-up of 3.7 years, 12 038 patients developed the combined CVD end point. Across all interventions, each 10 mum/y reduction of cIMT progression resulted in a relative risk for CVD of 0.91 (95% Credible Interval, 0.87-0.94), with an additional relative risk for CVD of 0.92 (0.87-0.97) being achieved independent of cIMT progression.

We used highly multiplexed proteomics to address these objectives, measuring about 5000 proteins in each of 32,130 archived plasma samples from 22,849 participants in nine clinical studies. We used machine learning to derive a 27-protein model predicting 4-year likelihood of myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, or death. The 27 proteins encompassed 10 biologic systems, and 12 were associated with relevant causal genetic traits. We independently validated results in 11,609 participants. Compared to a clinical model, the ratio of observed events in quintile 5 to quintile 1 was 6.7 for proteins versus 2.9 for the clinical model, AUCs (95% CI) were 0.73 (0.72 to 0.74) versus 0.64 (0.62 to 0.65), c-statistics were 0.71 (0.69 to 0.72) versus 0.62 (0.60 to 0.63), and the net reclassification index was +0.43. Adding the clinical model to the proteins only improved discrimination metrics by 0.01 to 0.02. Event rates in four predefined protein risk categories were 5.6, 11.2, 20.0, and 43.4% within 4 years; median time to event was 1.71 years. Protein predictions were directionally concordant with changed outcomes. Adverse risks were predicted for aging, approaching an event, anthracycline chemotherapy, diabetes, smoking, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer history, cardiovascular disease, high systolic blood pressure, and lipids. Reduced risks were predicted for weight loss and exenatide.

The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of PRSs in their population are often only reported for models that are adjusted for age and sex, which are known risk factors for the disease of interest and confound the association between the PRS and the disease. This makes comparison of PRS between studies difficult because the genetic effects cannot be disentangled from effects of age and sex (which have a high AUC without the PRS). In this study, we used data from the UK Biobank and applied the stacked clumping and thresholding method and a variation called maximum clumping and thresholding method to develop PRSs to predict coronary artery disease, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, stroke and type 2 diabetes. We created case-control training datasets in which age and sex were controlled by design. We also excluded prevalent cases to prevent biased estimation of disease risks. The maximum clumping and thresholding PRSs required many fewer single-nucleotide polymorphisms to achieve almost the same discriminatory ability as the stacked clumping and thresholding PRSs. Using the testing datasets, the AUCs for the maximum clumping and thresholding PRSs were 0.599 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.585, 0.613) for atrial fibrillation, 0.572 (95% CI: 0.560, 0.584) for coronary artery disease, 0.585 (95% CI: 0.564, 0.605) for type 2 diabetes, 0.559 (95% CI: 0.550, 0.569) for hypertension and 0.514 (95% CI: 0.494, 0.535) for stroke. By developing a PRS using a dataset in which age and sex are controlled by design, we have obtained true estimates of the discriminatory ability of the PRSs alone rather than estimates that include the effects of age and sex.Copyright: © 2022 Wong et al.

For those with enalapril and folic acid treatment, compared with the enalapril only group, the risk of first stroke was reduced from 6.5% to 3.0% (adjusted HR, 0.49; 95% CI: 0.35, 0.68) in hypertensive males with baseline albumin-corrected serum calcium >=2.43 mmol/L, whereas there was no significant effect among hypertensive males with baseline albumin-corrected serum calcium <2.43 mmol/L. However, among hypertensive females, serum calcium did not significantly affect the first stroke risk and the efficacy of folic acid in prevention of first stroke., CONCLUSIONS: Among Chinese hypertensive males, those with elevated serum calcium levels had increased risk of first stroke, and this risk was reduced by 51% with folic acid treatment.

These patients were categorized into three distinct groups: 264 in T2DM group, 401 in CAD group, and 204 in T2DM+CAD group. Logistic regression analysis was used to obtain odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) in predicting the risk probability of APOE.

However, whether the two diseases share a genetic basis and whether the relationship is causal remain unclear. It is also unclear as to whether these relationships differ between ethnic groups., METHODS: By leveraging large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics of T2D (European-based: Ncase = 21,926, Ncontrol = 342,747; East Asian-based: Ncase = 36,614, Ncontrol = 155,150) and PAD (European-based: Ncase = 5673, Ncontrol = 359,551; East Asian-based: Ncase = 3593, Ncontrol = 208,860), we explored the genetic correlation and putative causal relationship between T2D and PAD in both Europeans and East Asians using linkage disequilibrium score regression and seven Mendelian randomization (MR) models. We also performed multi-trait analysis of GWAS and two gene-based analyses to reveal candidate variants and risk genes involved in the shared genetic basis between T2D and PAD., RESULTS: We observed a strong genetic correlation (rg) between T2D and PAD in both Europeans (rg = 0.51; p-value = 9.34 x 10-15) and East Asians (rg = 0.46; p-value = 1.67 x 10-12). The MR analyses provided consistent evidence for a causal effect of T2D on PAD in both ethnicities (odds ratio [OR] = 1.05 to 1.28 for Europeans and 1.15 to 1.27 for East Asians) but not PAD on T2D. This putative causal effect was not influenced by total cholesterol, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, or smoking initiation according to multivariable MR analysis, and the genetic overlap between T2D and PAD was further explored employing an independent European sample through polygenic risk score regression. Multi-trait analysis of GWAS revealed two novel European-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs927742 and rs1734409) associated with the shared genetic basis of T2D and PAD. Gene-based analyses consistently identified one gene ANKFY1 and gene-gene interactions (e.g., STARD10 [European-specific] to AP3S2 [East Asian-specific]; KCNJ11 [European-specific] to KCNQ1 [East Asian-specific]) associated with the trans-ethnic genetic overlap between T2D and PAD, reflecting a common genetic basis for the co-occurrence of T2D and PAD in both Europeans and East Asians., CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides the first evidence for a genetically causal effect of T2D on PAD in both Europeans and East Asians. Several candidate variants and risk genes were identified as being associated with this genetic overlap. Our findings emphasize the importance of monitoring PAD status in T2D patients and suggest new genetic biomarkers for screening PAD risk among patients with T2D. Copyright © 2022.

Most studies suggest a specific role for PUFAs in cardioprotection from ischemic heart disease (IHD). However, few studies have used genetic biomarkers of n-3 PUFAs to examine their potential relationships with IHD. This study aimed to use Mendelian randomization to evaluate whether genetically-predicted n-3 PUFAs affect IHD and cardiometabolic risk factors (CRFs)., METHODS: Genetic variants strongly (p < 5 x 10-8) and independently (r2 > 0.1) associated with n-3 PUFAs were derived from the CHARGE Consortium (including 8,866 subjects of European ancestry) and were used as instrumental variables (IVs) for evaluating the effect of n-3 PUFAs, including alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Data on the associations between the IVs and IHD, myocardial infarction, and CRFs (including diabetes, lipids, blood pressure, body mass index, and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR)) were obtained from the UK Biobank SOFT CAD GWAS with the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D 1000 Genomes-based GWAS (113,937 IHD cases and 339,115 controls), the Myocardial Infarction Genetics and CARDIoGRAM Exome consortia (42,335 MI cases and 78,240 controls), the DIAbetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis consortium (26,676 diabetes mellitus cases and 132,532 controls), the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium (n = 196,475), the International Consortium for Blood Pressure (n = 69,395), and the meta-analysis of GWAS for body fat distribution in the UK Biobank and Genetic Investigation of Anthropometric Traits (n = 694,649)., RESULTS: Genetically-predicted higher ALA was associated with lower risk of IHD, type 2 diabetes (T2D), and lower serum lipids. The effect size per 0.05-unit increase (about 1 standard deviation) in plasma ALA level) was - 1.173 (95% confidence interval - 2.214 to - 0.133) for IHD. DPA and EPA had no association with IHD but were associated with a higher risk of T2D, higher levels of lipids or WHR. DHA had no association with IHD or CRFs., CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests a benefit of ALA for IHD and its main risk factors. DHA, DPA, and EPA had no association with IHD but were partly associated with increasing cardiometabolic risk factors. Copyright © 2021.

In this study, whether serum microRNA-137 (miR-137) could be used as a biomarker for diagnosing cerebral AS and predicting cerebrovascular event was investigated. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure the expression of miR-137 in serum. Logistic analysis was used to evaluate the risk factors for the occurrence of cerebral AS, and receiver operating characteristic curves were used to estimate the diagnostic value of miR-137 and other risk factors for AS occurrence. Furthermore, the prognostic value of miR-137 for patients with AS was estimated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression analysis. The results indicated that serum miR-137 levels were decreased in patients with cerebral AS. The expression of miR-137 was negatively correlated with total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in patients with cerebral AS. The levels of miR-137, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and hypersensitivity C response protein may serve as risk factors for the occurrence of cerebral AS, and miR-137 had diagnostic value for AS screening. Cerebral AS patients with positive cerebrovascular events have low miR-137 expression. Patients with high miR-137 expression had a lower incidence of cerebrovascular adverse events (log-rank P = 0.013), and miR-137 was an independent prognostic marker for the prediction of cerebrovascular event occurrence in patients with cerebral AS. In conclusions, our findings indicate that serum miR-137 levels are decreased in patients with cerebral AS and may be a new biomarker for diagnosing cerebral AS and predicting cerebrovascular events.

Up to now, it is unclear whether environmental or genetic factors might explain this phenomenon., METHODS: Using UK Biobank (UKB) data, we assessed CAD risk, based on the Framingham risk score (FRS) and common genetic variants, to explore the respective contribution to CAD prevalence in Scotland (n = 31,963) and England (n = 317,889). We calculated FRS based on sex, age, body mass index (BMI), total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), systolic blood pressure (SBP), antihypertensive medication, smoking status, and diabetes. We determined the allele frequency of published genome-wide significant risk CAD alleles and a weighted genetic risk score (wGRS) for quantifying genetic CAD risk., RESULTS: Prevalence of CAD was 16% higher in Scotland as compared to England (8.98% vs. 7.68%, P < 0.001). However, the FRS only predicted a marginally higher CAD risk (less than 1%) in Scotland (12.5 +/- 10.5 vs.12.6 +/- 10.6, P = 0.03). Likewise, the overall number of genome-wide significant variants affecting CAD risk (157.6 +/- 7.7 and 157.5 +/- 7.7; P = 0.12) and a wGRS for CAD (2.49 +/- 0.25 in both populations, P = 0.14) were remarkably similar in the English and Scottish population. Interestingly, we observed substantial differences in the allele frequencies of individual risk variants. Of the previously described 163 genome-wide significant variants studied here, 35 variants had higher frequencies in Scotland, whereas 37 had higher frequencies in England (P < 0.001 each)., CONCLUSIONS: Neither the traditional risk factors included in the FRS nor a genetic risk score (GRS) based on established common risk alleles explained the higher CAD prevalence in Scotland. However, we observed marked differences in the distribution of individual risk alleles, which emphasizes that even geographically and ethnically closely related populations may display relevant differences in the genetic architecture of a common disease.

According to our previous review, CTRP9 plays a vital role in the process of cardiovascular diseases, including regulating energy metabolism, modulating vasomotion, protecting endothelial cells, inhibiting platelet activation, inhibiting pathological vascular remodeling, stabilizing atherosclerotic plaques, and protecting the heart. We proposed that CTRP9 could play multiple positive and beneficial roles in vascular lesions in ischemic stroke (IS). Here, we aimed to study the relationship between serum CTRP9 and the etiology, severity, and prognosis of IS patients. Method(s): A total of 302 patients with IS and 173 non-stroke controls were selected from the same hospital, and all patients with IS were followed up 12 months after stroke onset. Stroke etiology was classified according to the Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment classification. Symptomatic severity was determined using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score. The lesion volume of acute cerebral ischemia was measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The unfavorable functional outcome was a combination of death or major disability 12 months after stroke onset. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) and net reclassification improvement (NRI) statistics were applied in the statistical analysis. Result(s): We found that serum CTRP9 levels and the ratios of CTRP9/total cholesterol (TC), CTRP9/triglyceride (TG), CTRP9/low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and CTRP9/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were associated with the presence of IS. Moreover, the serum CTRP9 concentration was positively associated with the severity of IS. Incorporation of CTRP9/LDL-C levels into a fully adjusted model for IS-cardioembolic (CE) improved discrimination and calibration, and significantly improved reclassification. In addition, CTRP9 was a predictor of unfavorable functional outcomes. Conclusion(s): All the findings indicated that serum CTRP9 could be a promising blood-derived biomarker for the early evaluation and prognosis assessment of IS.

However, previous studies using genetic polymorphisms on the causal relationship between alcohol consumption and AF have reported conflicting results. This study aimed to evaluate the causality between alcohol consumption and AF using the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) rs671 polymorphism, which is the genetic variant with the most potent effect on drinking behavior. Method(s): A total of 8,964 participants from the Dong-gu Study were included in the present study. The causal association between alcohol consumption and AF was evaluated through a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using the ALDH2 rs671 polymorphism as an instrumental variable. Result(s): No significant relationship between alcohol consumption and AF was found in the observational analysis. However, the genetic analysis using the ALDH2 polymorphism showed a significant association in men. In the MR analysis, genetically predicted daily alcohol consumption was positively related to AF. Conclusion(s): MR analysis revealed a significant association between the amount of alcohol consumption and AF, which suggests that the association may be causal.Copyright © 2022.

Our previous work has shown that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of LDLR, APOB, and PCSK9 are associated with dyslipidemia, but how these SNPs correlate with risk for PMI is unknown. Objective(s): This study aims to evaluate the association between SNPs of LDLR, APOB, and PCSK9 and risk of PMI in Chinese Han population. Method(s): Two cohorts were established. In Cohort 1 (413 in the PMI group and 1,239 in the control group), SNPs of APOB, LDLR, and PCSK9 with minor allele frequency (MAF) > 1%, which has been shown to impact the risk of PMI in a Chinese Han population, were thoroughly examined, and gene-environment interactions were analyzed. A model for PMI risk prediction was developed in Cohort 1 and externally validated in Cohort 2 (577 in the PMI group and 270 in the control group). Result(s): The distribution of the T allele at the PCSK9 R93C variant (rs151193009, C > T) was lower in the PMI group than that in the control group (PMI vs. Control in Cohort 1, 0.8% vs. 2.3%, Padjust < 0.05; in Cohort 2, 1.0% vs. 2.4%, Padjust < 0.05). The T allele at PCSK9 R93C variant (rs151193009, C > T) reduced the risk of PMI by ~60% regardless of adjusting for confounding factors (in Cohort 1, adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.354, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.139-0.900, p = 0.029; in Cohort 2, adjusted OR 0.394, 95% CI 0.157-0.987, p = 0.047). No gene-environment interactions were observed between the R93C variant and diabetes/hypertension/smoking in PMI occurrence in this Chinese Han population. Our model showed good performance in predicting the risk of PMI in Cohort 1 (AUC 0.839, 95% CI 0.815-0.862, p < 0.001) and in an external cohort (AUC 0.840, 95% CI 0.810-0.871, p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): The PCSK9 R93C variant was associated with significantly reduced risk of PMI in the Chinese Han population, and the model we developed performed well in predicting PMI risk in this Chinese Han population.Copyright © 2022 Yang, Pu, Zhang, Yan, Yu and Gao.","Authors":"Yang, L.; Pu, T.; Zhang, Y.; Yan, H.; Yu, H.; Gao, W.","Publisher":"Frontiers in Genetics","Issue":"Not Available","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2022.875269","Pages":"875269","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"PCSK9 R93C variant & variants of LDLR & APOB"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":15,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":25,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":26,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":37,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":41,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":46,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":49,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":55,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":56,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":4145,"Title":"Development of a Risk Score for Atrial Fibrillation in Adults With Diabetes Mellitus (from the ACCORD Study)","Year":2020,"Country":"","Abstract":"We aimed to develop a novel risk score predicting 5-year atrial fibrillation (AF) risk for diabetes mellitus (DM) patients.

A 5-year risk score for incident AF was developed using Cox regression with internal validation. We studied 9,240 subjects with DM (62% male, mean age 62.6 years) of which 1.8% (n=165) developed AF over a median follow-up of 4.9 years. Subjects developing AF were more likely male, of white ethnicity and with more obesity and poorer kidney function, but with lower diastolic blood pressure and low density-lipoprotein cholesterol. In the risk prediction model, age, gender, race, body mass index, heart failure, diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides, hemoglobin A1c, duration of DM, serum creatinine and hypertension medication were included as important predictors. The Harrell's C-statistic was 0.79 with excellent internal calibration (goodness-of-fit test p=0.99 and calibration slope=1.01). Our risk model may be useful for assess future AF risk in DM patients.

Variants of ABCA1/G1 have been implicated in etiology of IS. This study aimed to investigate the association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ABCA1/G1 with plasma lipid variability and the risk of IS in Chinese Han Population. Method(s): Totally 249 IS patients and 226 healthy controls were enrolled and 10 SNPs of ABCA1/G1 were screened for genotyping by kompetitive allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (KASP) and validated by sanger sequencing. The logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk alleles of IS and appropriate genetic model. The genetic risk scores (GRS) and predicted risks for all individuals was computed. Based on different plasma lipid levels, we applied stratified analyses for subgroups. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) test was used to explore different functional haplotype combinations. Association between specific allele or genotype of the SNPs of ABCA1/G1 and plasma lipid or lipoproteins levels were also investigated. Result(s): Besides total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), significant differences of clinical data were observed between IS and control group. The rare GG genotype frequencies of rs4149338 on ABCA1 was higher in IS patients than those in controls (11.4%, 4.6%, respectively, P = 0.037). Frequencies of rs57137919 on ABCG1 for rare AA genotype was lower in IS group than those in control group (4.6%, 13.3%, respectively, P = 0.030). GRS showed ability to discriminate IS patients and controls (AUC = 0.633, P < 0.001). Haplotype A-A (rs4149339-rs4149338) was correlated with reduced risk of IS (P = 0.023). Association analysis showed that subjects with rare AA genotype of rs57137919 had the lowest LDL-C levels while rare GG genotype of rs4149338 had lower TC level than those with AA genotype. The mRNA expression of ABCG1 was higher in IS patients, especially in the patients with frequent GG genotype of rs57137919, and was positively correlated with higher ABCG1 expression level and plasma LDL-C level.

Method(s): A total of 93,838 UK Biobank participants with metabolomics data were included in the study. Plasma metabolites associated with GCIPLT were identified in 7,824 participants who also underwent retinal optical coherence tomography; prospective associations of GCIPLT-associated metabolites with 12-year risk of mortality and major age-related diseases were assessed in 86,014 participants. The primary outcomes included all- and specific-cause mortality. The secondary outcomes included incident type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS), myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure, ischemic stroke, and dementia. C-statistics and net reclassification indexes (NRIs) were calculated to evaluate the added predictive value of GCIPLT metabolites. Calibration was assessed using calibration plots. Finding(s): Sixteen metabolomic signatures were associated with GCIPLT (P< 0.009 [Bonferroni-corrected threshold]), and most were associated with the future risk of mortality and age-related diseases. The constructed meta-GCIPLT scores distinguished well between patients with high and low risks of mortality and morbidity, showing predictive values higher than or comparable to those of traditional risk factors (C-statistics: 0.780[0.771-0.788], T2DM; 0.725[0.707-0.743], OSAHS; 0.711[0.695-0.726], MI; 0.685[0.662-0.707], cardiovascular mortality; 0.657[0.640-0.674], heart failure; 0.638[0.636-0.660], other mortality; 0.630[0.618-0.642], all-cause mortality; 0.620[0.598-0.643], dementia; 0.614[0.593-0.634], stroke; and 0.601[0.585-0.617], cancer mortality). The NRIs confirmed the inclusion of GCIPLT metabolomic signatures to the models based on traditional risk factors resulted in significant improvements in model performance (5.18%, T2DM [P=3.86E-11]; 4.43%, dementia [P=0.003]; 4.20%, cardiovascular mortality [P=6.04E-04]; 3.73%, MI [P=1.72E-07]; 2.93%, OSAHS [P=3.13E-05]; 2.39%, all-cause, mortality [P=3.89E-05]; 2.33%, stroke [P=0.049]; 2.09%, cancer mortality [P=0.039]; and 1.59%, heart failure [P=2.72E-083.07E-04]). Calibration plots showed excellent calibration between predicted risk and actual incidence in the new models. Interpretation(s): GCIPLT-associated plasma metabolites captured the residual risk for mortality and major systemic diseases not quantified by traditional risk factors in the general population. Incorporating GCIPLT metabolomic signatures into prediction models may assist in screening for future risks of these health outcomes.

Herein, we aimed to explore the effects of genetic polymorphisms in the IGF1 pathway on stroke in the Chinese Han population. Method(s): Twenty-six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IGF1 pathway genes were genotyped in a case-control study consisting of 2070 stroke cases and 2243 controls. Main genetic effects and gene-gene interactive effects of the IGF1 pathway were evaluated. Weighted genetic risk scores (wGRS) were computed, and the associations between wGRS and gene expression were analysed. Result(s): The variants at GHRH rs6032470 were significantly associated with high risk of hemorrhagic stroke (HS), and the adjusted OR (95%CI) was 1.368 (1.136-1.647). Significant additive interaction between rs6032470 and gender was detected for HS and ischemic stroke (IS). The association of rs6032470 and stroke was stronger in males than in females. Additionally, a significant gene-gene interaction of rs6032470-rs1874479 (IGFBP1) in relation to HS risk was identified (p < 0.05). IGF1 mRNA expression was significantly upregulated in IS, while it was linearly downregulated across rs6214 genotypes. In addition, IGFBP3 transcript variant 2 mRNA level was negatively correlated with wGRS (r = -0.285, p = 0.005). Conclusion(s): Our findings indicated that the IGF1 signalling pathway genes potentiated the risk of stroke through both main effects and gene-gene interactions. The genetic effect of GHRH rs6032470 on stroke was gender dependent. The wGRS of IGF1 pathway genes may be an independent predictor of stroke risk.Copyright © 2020 The Authors","Authors":"Yao, Y.; Zhu, H.; Zhu, L.; Fang, Z.; Fan, Y.; Liu, C.; Tian, Y.; Tang, W.; Ren, Z.; Li, J.; Yang, S.; Chen, Y.; Zhao, X.; Shen, C.","Publisher":"Atherosclerosis","Issue":"Not Available","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2020.01.009","Pages":"59-65","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"26 SNPs from 7 IGF1 genes"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":42,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":47,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":49,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":50,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":51,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":56,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":4177,"Title":"Interactions Between Enhanced Polygenic Risk Scores and Lifestyle for Cardiovascular Disease, Diabetes, and Lipid Levels","Year":2021,"Country":"","Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Both lifestyle and genetic factors confer risk for cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, and dyslipidemia. However, the interactions between these 2 groups of risk factors were not comprehensively understood due to previous poor estimation of genetic risk. Here we set out to develop enhanced polygenic risk scores (PRS) and systematically investigate multiplicative and additive interactions between PRS and lifestyle for coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, total cholesterol, triglyceride, and LDL-cholesterol., METHODS: Our study included 276 096 unrelated White British participants from the UK Biobank. We investigated several PRS methods (P+T, LDpred, PRS continuous shrinkage, and AnnoPred) and showed that AnnoPred achieved consistently improved prediction accuracy for all 6 diseases/traits. With enhanced PRS and combined lifestyle status categorized by smoking, body mass index, physical activity, and diet, we investigated both multiplicative and additive interactions between PRS and lifestyle using regression models., RESULTS: We observed that healthy lifestyle reduced disease incidence by similar multiplicative magnitude across different PRS groups. The absolute risk reduction from lifestyle adherence was, however, significantly greater in individuals with higher PRS. Specifically, for type 2 diabetes, the absolute risk reduction from lifestyle adherence was 12.4% (95% CI, 10.0%-14.9%) in the top 1% PRS versus 2.8% (95% CI, 2.3%-3.3%) in the bottom PRS decile, leading to a ratio of >4.4. We also observed a significant interaction effect between PRS and lifestyle on triglyceride level., CONCLUSIONS: By leveraging functional annotations, AnnoPred outperforms state-of-the-art methods on quantifying genetic risk through PRS. Our analyses based on enhanced PRS suggest that individuals with high genetic risk may derive similar relative but greater absolute benefit from lifestyle adherence.","Authors":"Ye, Yixuan; Chen, Xi; Han, James; Jiang, Wei; Natarajan, Pradeep; Zhao, Hongyu","Publisher":"Circulation.

Cer(d18:1/16:0), Cer(d18:1/22:0), and Cer(d18:1/24:0) were highly significant in predicting MACE [multiadjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval, CI) per SD were 1.76 (1.34-2.30), 0.55 (0.41-0.73), and 0.66 (0.47-0.92), respectively]. Compared with traditional variables (comprising presence of CV risk factors, hypertension-mediated organ damage, and comorbidities), a novel CERT for hypertensive patients (CERT-HBP), composed of Cer(d18:1/16:0), Cer(d18:1/24:1), and their ratios to Cer(d18:1/24:0) and Cer(d18:1/22:0), respectively, increased the C-statistic from 0.751 (95% CI, 0.697-0.806) to 0.791 (95% CI, 0.737-0.845), P = 0.010. Net reclassification improvement and integrated discrimination improvement were 0.648 (95% CI, 0.421-0.885, P < 0.001) and 0.046 (95% CI, 0.025-0.068, P < 0.001), respectively., CONCLUSIONS: A ceramide-based CERT-HBP was established to evaluate risk of MACE in hypertensive patients at high CV risk. This may improve identification of high-risk patients requiring increased attention and aggressive therapy., CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: Trial Number NCT03708601. Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

We aimed to assess the contribution of WNT2B genetic variant to ischemic stroke (IS) susceptibility in the Chinese Han population. Five polymorphisms including rs3790606, rs351364, rs3790608, rs12037987, and rs10776752 in WNT2B were genotyped using Agena MassARRAY platform in 476 healthy controls and 501 patients with IS. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) adjusted for age and gender were estimated by logistic regression analysis. Analysis of variance was used to evaluate the association between genotypes of WNT2B variants and blood lipid parameters. Rs12037987 (OR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.18-2.82, P = 0.007) and rs10776752 (OR = 1.74, 95% CI: 1.13-2.68, P = 0.012) were related to the increased IS susceptibility.

Therefore, we conducted Mendelian randomization (MR) to assess whether genetically predicted PUFA affected IS, lipids and blood pressure (BP). Method(s): Genetic instruments associated with IS were derived from ISGC Consortium (n = 29,633), with lipids were derived from GLGC(n = 188,577), with BP were derived from Neale Lab(n = 337,000). The inverse-variance weighted method was the main analysis to estimate the effect of exposure on outcome.

We aimed to investigate the association of and potential interactions among genetic risk for T2D, lifestyle behavior, and metabolic risk factors with CVD. Method(s): A total of 345,217 unrelated participants of white British descent were included in analyses. Genetic risk for T2D was estimated as a genome-wide polygenic risk score constructed from > 6 million genetic variants. A favorable lifestyle was defined in terms of four modifiable lifestyle components, and metabolic health status was determined according to the presence of metabolic syndrome components. Result(s): During a median follow-up of 8.9 years, 21,865 CVD cases (6.3%) were identified. Compared with the low genetic risk group, participants at high genetic risk for T2D had higher rates of overall CVD events, CVD subtypes (coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation/flutter), and CVD mortality. Individuals at very high genetic risk for T2D had a 35% higher risk of CVD than those with low genetic risk (HR 1.35 [95% CI 1.19 to 1.53]). A significant gradient of increased CVD risk was observed across genetic risk, lifestyle, and metabolic health status (P for trend > 0.001). Those with favorable lifestyle and metabolically healthy status had significantly reduced risk of CVD events regardless of T2D genetic risk. This risk reduction was more apparent in young participants (<= 50 years). Conclusion(s): Genetic risk for T2D was associated with increased risks of overall CVD, various CVD subtypes, and fatal CVD. Engaging in a healthy lifestyle and maintaining metabolic health may reduce subsequent risk of CVD regardless of genetic risk for T2D.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s).","Authors":"Yun, J. S.; Jung, S.

Method(s): Forty-one patients with suspected CAD underwent within 7 days apart rest-stress cardiac PET with 82Rb and DSE followed by cardiac 18F-FDG PET imaging. 18F-FDG images were scored on a 0 (no discernible uptake) to 2 (intense uptake) scale. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of stress-induced ischemia. The incremental value of 18F-FDG PET over DSE in detecting ischemia at 82Rb PET cardiac imaging was assessed by the likelihood ratio chi-square and net reclassification index. Result(s): On 82Rb-PET imaging, myocardial ischemia (ischemic total perfusion defect >= 5%) was detected in 20 (49%) patients. Inducible ischemia was found in 22 (54%) patients on DSE (biphasic or worsening response pattern in >= 1 segment) and in 21 (51%) patients on 18F-FDG PET (uptake score of 2 in >= 1 segment). 18F-FDG PET resulted as statistically significant predictor of ischemia on 82Rb-PET. The addition of 18F-FDG PET to DSE increased the likelihood of ischemia on 82Rb-PET (P <.05). 18F-FDG PET was able to reclassify the probability of stress-induced myocardial ischemia on both patient and vessel analyses. Conclusion(s): 18F-FDG PET performed after dobutamine stress test may provide incremental value to DSE in the evaluation of myocardial ischemia. These results suggest that stress-induced myocardial ischemia can be imaged directly using 18F-FDG PET after dobutamine stress test.Copyright © 2021, American Society of Nuclear Cardiology.","Authors":"Zampella, E.; Assante, R.; Acampa, W.; Gaudieri, V.; Nappi, C.; Mannarino, T.; D'Antonio, A.; Buongiorno, P.; Panico, M.; Mainolfi, C.

We performed multivariable-adjusted regression models to assess associations of random spot measurements of the urine sodium-potassium ratio (UNa/UK) and urine albumin adjusted for creatinine with cardiovascular risk factors, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) in 478 311 participants of the UK Biobank. Further, we assessed the causal relationships of these kidney biomarkers, used as proxies for kidney function, with cardiovascular outcomes using the 2-sample Mendelian randomization approach. In observational analyses, UNa/UK showed significant inverse associations with atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke, lipid-lowering medication, and T2D. In contrast, urine albumin adjusted for creatinine showed significant positive associations with atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, heart failure, hemorrhagic stroke, lipid-lowering medication, and T2D. We found a positive association between UNa/UK and albumin with blood pressure (BP), as well as with adiposity-related measures. After correcting for potential horizontal pleiotropy, we found evidence of causal associations of UNa/UK and albumin with BP (beta systolic BP >=2.63; beta diastolic BP >=0.85 SD increase in BP per SD change in UNa/UK and urine albumin adjusted for creatinine; P<=0.04), and of albumin with T2D (odds ratio=1.33 per SD change in albumin, P=0.02). Our comprehensive study of urinary biomarkers performed using state-of-the-art analyses of causality mirror and extend findings from randomized interventional trials which have established UNa/UK as a risk factor for hypertension. In addition, we detect a causal feedback loop between albumin and hypertension, and our finding of a bidirectional causal association between albumin and T2D reflects the well-known nephropathy in T2D.Copyright © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Prediction models developed using novel methods may be useful to identify patients with CKD at highest risk of incident AF. We compared a previously published prediction model with models developed using machine learning methods in a CKD population. Design, setting, participants, & measurements We studied 2766 participants in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort study without prior AF with complete cardiac biomarker (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide and high-sensitivity troponin T) and clinical data. We evaluated the utility of machine learning methods as well as a previously validated clinical prediction model (Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology [CHARGE]-AF, which included 11 predictors, using original and re-estimated coefficients) to predict incident AF. Discriminatory ability of each model was assessed using the ten-fold cross-validated C-index; calibration was evaluated graphically and with the Gronnesby and Borgan test. Results Mean (SD) age of participants was 57 (11) years, 55% were men, 38% were Black, and mean (SD) eGFR was 45 (15) ml/min per 1.73 m2; 259 incident AF events occurred during a median of 8 years of follow-up. The CHARGE-AF prediction equation using original and re-estimated coefficients had C-indices of 0.67 (95% confidence interval, 0.64 to 0.71) and 0.67 (95% confidence interval, 0.64 to 0.70), respectively.

We here genetically predict the causal association between specific smoking features and biomarkers for smokers and IA risk. The Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis considered summary statistics from the largest current genome-wide association studies of smoking and IA. The inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method, weighted median method, MR-RAPS, and multiple variants Mendelian randomization (MVMR) were performed to estimate the effect of different smoking features and drinking in IA. We observed significant causal effects of smoking on the risk of both aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and unruptured IA (uIA). The ORs of IAs based on the IVW method were 1.890 (95% CI 1.486-2.405) of ever smoking regularly. MVMR analysis afforded odds ratios of 1.685 (95% CI 1.136-2.501). In the further subgroup analysis, a similar causal relationship was observed in aSAH. Moreover, our analyses suggested that higher blood cotinine level and cadmium increases aSAH risk, and ORs were 1.235 (95%CI 1.009-1.186) and 1.235 (95%CI 1.046-1.458), respectively. Our study suggests that ever smoking regularly is associated with the IA risk, which includes both uIA and aSAH. Besides, higher blood cadmium and cotinine level may increases IA and aSAH risk. Thus, tobacco control should be promoted as primordial prevention for IAs, and screening for patients with a smoking history is emphasized. Copyright © 2022.

However, the relationship between methylation and ischemic stroke has not yet been clarified. We conducted a large-sample sequencing study to identify blood leukocyte DNA methylations as novel biomarkers for ischemic stroke risk and prognosis based on previously identified genetic loci. Method(s): Methylation levels of 17 genes were measured by sequencing in 271 ischemic stroke cases and 323 controls, and the significant associations were validated in another independent sample of 852 cases and 925 controls. The associations between methylation levels and ischemic stroke risk and prognosis were evaluated. Result(s): Methylation of AMH, C17orf82, HDAC9, IGFBP3, LRRC10B, PDE3A, PRDM6, SYT7 and TBX2 was significantly associated with ischemic stroke. Compared to participants without any hypomethylated targets, the odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval, CI) for those with 9 hypomethylated genes was 1.41 (1.33-1.51) for ischemic stroke. Adding methylation levels of the 9 genes to the basic model of traditional risk factors significantly improved the risk stratification for ischemic stroke. Associations between AMH, HDAC9, IGFBP3, PDE3A and PRDM6 gene methylation and modified Rankin Scale scores were significant after adjustment for covariates. Lower methylation levels of AMH, C17orf82, PRDM6 and TBX2 were significantly associated with increased 3-month mortality. Compared to patients without any hypomethylated targets, the OR (95% CI) for those with 4 hypomethylated targets was 1.12 (1.08-1.15) for 3-month mortality (P = 2.28 x 10-10). Conclusion(s): The present study identified blood leukocyte DNA methylations as potential factors affecting ischemic stroke risk and prognosis among Han Chinese individuals.Copyright © 2022 Zhang, Mo, Wang, Peng, Guo, Zhong, Zhu, Xu and Zhang.","Authors":"Zhang, H.; Mo, X.; Wang, A.; Peng, H.; Guo, D.; Zhong, C.; Zhu, Z.; Xu, T.; Zhang, Y.","Publisher":"Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine","Issue":"Not Available","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fcvm.2022.796245","Pages":"796245","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"blood leukocyte DNA methylation"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":3,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":24,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":42,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":47,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":49,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":4283,"Title":"Lacune and Large Perivascular Space: Two Kinds of Cavities Are of Different Risk Factors and Stroke Risk","Year":2020,"Country":"","Abstract":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To compare the risk factors and risk of stroke between lacune and large perivascular spaces (PVSs) in a community-based sample., METHODS: Large PVSs were assessed using 3.0T MRI in a population-based cohort consisting of 1,204 participants. The relationship between cardiovascular risk factors, neuroimaging changes, and incidental stroke risk and the presence of lacune or large PVSs was assessed with univariate and multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis., RESULTS: Of the 1,204 study participants (55.7 +/- 9.3 years, 37.0% men), a total of 347 large PVSs were detected in 235 (19.5%) subjects, while a total of 219 lacunes were detected in 183 subjects (15.2%). The presence of lacunes was found to be significantly associated with age, male gender, hypertension, and diabetes, whereas only age (p < 0.01) and ApoEepsilon4 carrier status (p < 0.01) were related to the presence of large PVSs. Those who had lacunes detected on MRI at baseline had a significant increased risk of stroke (hazard ratio [HR] 4.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-19.07) during the 3-year follow-up independent of age, gender, and other vascular risk factors. However, there was no significant relationship between the presence of large PVSs and incident stroke (HR 3.84; 95% CI, 0.82-18.04)., CONCLUSIONS: The lack of association between large PVSs and cardiovascular risk factors or risk of stroke indicated a nonvascular pathogenic mechanism underlying large PVSs, suggesting the importance of distinguishing large PVSs from lacunes in clinical practice.

Rapid identification of IHD-DM can enable early access to medical treatment and reduce the occurrence of cardiovascular adverse events. In the present study, we identified and examined extracellular vesicle (EV)-carried microRNAs (miRNAs) as the possible diagnostic biomarkers of IHD-DM. Small RNA sequencing was performed to analyze the EV-carried miRNAs spectrum, and differentially expressed miRNAs were further confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Through small RNA sequencing, we identified 138 differentially expressed EV-carried miRNAs between IHD-DM patients and healthy controls. Furthermore, we identified that five EV-carried miRNAs (miR-15a-3p, miR-18a-5p, miR-133a-3p, miR-155-5p, and miR-210-3p) were significantly down-regulated and one (miR-19a-3p) was significantly up-regulated in the IHD-DM patients compared to healthy controls. The receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the above six EV-carried miRNAs have excellent diagnostic efficacy of IHD-DM.

This study aimed to examine the association between SUA and ischemic stroke in essential hypertension patients. Methods: This retrospective study recruited participants from September 2011 to December 2012, in the Liao-bu community, Guangdong Province, China, and followed them until 31 December 2016. Participants were divided into quartiles based on SUA concentrations. Hazard ratio (HR) and confidence intervals (CIs) was estimated from Cox proportional hazards models, and propensity score analysis, Kaplan-Meier survival curves and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were performed to evaluate the relationship between SUA and the risk of ischemic stroke. Results: A total of 5473 eligible hypertensive subjects were enrolled in this study, 2666 (48.71%) of them were males with an average age of 62.02 +/- 13.76 years. A total of 155 (2.83%) ischemic stroke occurred after the mean follow-up period of 4.5 years. After adjusting for potential confounders, comparing with the lowest quartiles of SUA, multivariable HR (95%CI) for ischemic stroke for participants with SUA at the second, third and fourth quartiles were 1.13 (95%CI: 1.10, 1.81), 1.39 (95%CI: 1.18, 1.89), and 1.64 (95%CI: 1.19, 1.95), respectively (P < 0.0001 for trend). Elevated SUA was positively associated with ischemic stroke (HR = 1.41, 95%CI: 1.16, 1.84; P < 0.01) and the propensity scores analysis (HR = 1.45, 95%CI: 1.17, 1.90; P < 0.01) showed the similar results. Gender subgroup analysis showed SUA was an independent risk of ischemic stroke in female (HR = 1.35, 95%CI: 1.11, 1.81, P = 0.002) and male (HR = 1.53, 95%CI: 1.14, 1.92, P < 0.001).

It is caused by genetic and environmental factors or their interactions. Candidate gene association studies are an important genetic strategy for the study of complex diseases, and multiple variants of inflammatory cytokines have been found to be associated with CAD using this method. Interleukin-5 (IL-5) is an important inflammatory immune response factor that plays a role in a various inflammatory disease. Clinical tests and animal experiments indicated that IL-5 is involved in CAD development, but the exact mechanisms are unclear. This study investigated the genetic relationship between the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IL5 and CAD., Materials and Methods: Based on the Chinese Han population, we collected 1,824 patients with CAD and 1,920 control subjects and performed a two-stage case-control association analysis for three SNPs in IL5 (rs2057687, rs78546665, and rs2069812) using the high resolution melt (HRM) technology. Logistic regression analyses were applied to adjust for traditional risk factors for CAD and to perform haplotype and gene interaction analyses. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to study relationships between the selected SNPs and serum lipid levels., Results: In this study, two-stage case-control association analysis revealed that the allele and genotype frequency distributions of the three IL5 SNPs were not statistically significant between the case and control groups. In addition, none of the IL5 haplotypes were associated with CAD. Further stratified analyses were conducted by sex, age, hypertension, and disease status, respectively, and the results revealed that the rs2057687 and rs2069812 of IL5 were associated with CAD in the male group (p adj = 0.025, OR, 0.77 (95% CI, 0.62-0.97); p adj = 0.016, OR, 0.82 (95% CI, 0.70-0.97), respectively); the rs2057687 and rs78546665 of IL5 were associated with late-onset CAD (p adj = 0.039, OR, 0.78 (95% CI, 0.62-0.99); p adj = 0.036, OR, 1.46 (95% CI, 1.02-1.53), respectively); the rs2069812 of IL5 was associated with CAD in the hypertension group (p adj = 0.036, OR, 0.84 (95% CI, 0.71-0.99)); and none of the SNPs in IL5 were associated with different CAD states (anatomical CAD and clinical CAD). In addition, the association between SNPs and the serum lipid levels indicated that rs78546665 was positively correlated with triglyceride levels (p = 0.012). Finally, SNP-SNP interaction analyses revealed that interactions of rs2057687 and rs2069812 were associated with CAD (p adj = 0.046, OR, 0.77 (95% CI, 0.13-4.68))., Conclusion: This study suggested that the common variants of IL5 might play a role in CAD by affecting the risk factors for CAD and through SNP-SNP interactions, which provides a new target for specific treatment of CAD patients and a theoretical basis for personalized medicine.

Hence, a novel multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) approach was applied to solve this issue. Method(s): The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from a recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) on years of schooling served as instruments. Univariable mendelian randomization (MR) and MVMR analyses were performed to detect the relationship between genetically predicted EA and the stroke risk. In the MVMR, cigarette consumption, alcohol consumption, body mass index (BMI), intelligence, and hypertension were adjusted. The summary statistics for stroke from the MEGASTROKE consortium included 446,696 participants (40,585 cases of stroke and 34,217 cases of ischemic stroke), most of whom were of European descent. Result(s): In the univariable MR, genetically predicated EA could decrease the risks of total stroke (OR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.61-0.72, P = 2.70 x 10-23), ischemic stroke (OR = 0.67, 95% CI 0.61-0.73, P = 2.58 x 10-18), large artery atherosclerosis (OR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.40-0.64, P = 1.80 x 10-8), small vessel stroke (OR = 0.60, 95% CI 0.49-0.73, P = 5.59 x 10-7), and cardioembolic stroke (OR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.68-0.96, P = 1.46 x 10-2) using the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) estimator.

To date, it is still unclear whether circulating long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as emerging biomarkers, can improve the predictive power of the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score in stroke and all-cause mortality., METHODS: Candidate lncRNAs were screened by searching the literature and analyzing previous RNA sequencing results. After preliminary verification in 29 patients with AF, the final selected lncRNAs were evaluated by Cox proportional hazards regression in 192 patients to determine whether their relative expression levels were associated with stroke and all-cause mortality. The c-statistic, net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement of the patients were calculated to evaluate the discrimination and reclassification power for stroke and all-cause mortality when adding lncRNA expression levels to the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score model., RESULTS: Five plasma lncRNAs associated with stroke and all-cause mortality in AF patients were selected in our screening process. Patients with elevated H19 levels were found to have a higher risk of stroke (hazard ratio [HR] 3.264, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.364-7.813, P = 0.008). Adding the H19 expression level to the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score significantly improved the discrimination and reclassification power of the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score for stroke in AF patients. In addition, the H19 level showed a marginally significant association with all-cause mortality (HR 2.263, 95% CI: 0.889-5.760, P = 0.087), although it appeared to have no significant improvement for the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc model for predicting all-cause mortality., CONCLUSIONS: Plasma expression of H19 was associated with stroke risk in AF patients and improved the discriminatory power of the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score.

However, the results are inconclusive. Objective(s): We aimed to evaluate whether genetically predicted coffee consumption is associated with AD and stroke using Mendelian randomization (MR) design. Method(s): Summary-level data for AD (n = 54,162), ischemic stroke (n = 440,328), and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH, n = 3,026) were adopted from publicly available databases. Summary-level data for coffee consumption were obtained from two genome-wide association studies, comprising up to 375,833 subjects. Result(s): Genetically predicted coffee consumption (cups/day) was associated with an increased risk of AD (OR = 1.26, 95%CI = 1.05-1.51). Moreover, genetically predicted 50%increase of coffee consumption was associated with an increased risk of ICH (OR: 2.27, 95%CI: 1.08-4.78) but a decreased risk of small vessel stroke (OR: 0.71, 95%CI: 0.51-0.996). Estimate for AD and ICH in FinnGen consortium is directionally consistent. Combined analysis of different databases further confirmed that genetically predicted coffee consumption was associated with an increased risk of AD and ICH. In the multivariable MR analysis, genetically predicted coffee consumption retained a stable effect with AD and ICH when adjusting for smoking (p < 0.05), while the association with AD attenuated when adjusting for alcohol use. Conclusion(s): Our results indicate that genetically predicted coffee consumption may be associated with an increased risk of AD and ICH. The underlying biological mechanisms warrant further study.Copyright © 2021 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.","Authors":"Zhang, Z.; Wang, M.; Yuan, S.; Cai, H.; Zhu, S.

A Mendelian randomization study","Year":2022,"Country":"","Abstract":"Background: l-carnitine is emerging as an item of interest for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention and treatment, but controversy exists. To examine the effectiveness and safety of l-carnitine, we assessed how genetically different levels of l-carnitine are associated with CVD risk and its risk factors. Given higher CVD incidence and l-carnitine in men, we also examined sex-specific associations. Method(s): We used Mendelian randomization to obtain unconfounded estimates. Specifically, we used genetic variants to predict l-carnitine, and obtained their associations with coronary artery disease (CAD), ischemic stroke, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation, as well as CVD risk factors (type 2 diabetes, glucose, HbA1c, insulin, lipid profile, blood pressure and body mass index) in large consortia and established cohorts, as well as sex-specific association in the UK Biobank. We obtained the Wald estimates (genetic association with CVD and its risk factors divided by the genetic association with l-carnitine) and combined them using inverse variance weighting. In sensitivity analysis, we used different analysis methods robust to pleiotropy and replicated using an l-carnitine isoform, acetyl-carnitine. Result(s): Genetically predicted l-carnitine was nominally associated with higher risk of CAD overall (OR 1.07 per standard deviation (SD) increase in l-carnitine, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.11) and in men (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.16) but had a null association in women (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.09). These associations were also robust to different methods and evident for acetyl-carnitine. Conclusion(s): Our findings do not support a beneficial association of l-carnitine with CVD and its risk factors but suggest potential harm. l-carnitine may also exert a sex-specific role in CAD. Consideration of the possible sex disparity and exploration of the underlying pathways would be worthwhile.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s).","Authors":"Zhao, J.

To explore the influence of genetic factors on stroke susceptibility, we investigated the association between four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 2 (PITX2) gene and stroke risk. Method(s): A total of 977 volunteers including 476 stroke patients and 501 control individuals were recruited. The association between PITX2 polymorphisms and stroke risk was evaluated using genetic models and haplotype analyses. The strength of the association between each studied polymorphisms and stroke risk was evaluated by calculating odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). What's more, multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) was used to predict the interaction between SNPs. Result(s): Our study showed that rs6817105 in PITX2 was related to a significant increase in stroke susceptibility (OR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.04-1.94, p = 0.028). Stratified analyses based on gender indicated that rs6817105, rs13143308, and rs6843082 polymorphisms were significantly associated with an increased risk of stroke in male (OR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.47-0.99, p = 0.042; OR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.30-0.96, p = 0.035; and OR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.30-0.99, p = 0.047). Besides, SNP rs6817105 was significantly increased the risk of stroke in people at age over 65 years (OR = 1.87, 95% CI =1.12-3.11, p = 0.016). MDR showed that the interaction model of rs6817105 and rs3853445 emerged as the best predictor between the PITX2 gene and stroke susceptibility.

Myocardial stretch is the main factor to stimulate NT Pro-BNP secretion in cardiomyocytes. NT Pro-BNP is an important risk factor for cardiac dysfunction, stroke, and pulmonary embolism. So does atrial myocyte stretching occur when patients have atrial fibrillation (AF)? Whether atrial muscle stretch induced by AF leads to increased NT Pro-BNP remains unclear. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between NT Pro-BNP and AF., HYPOTHESIS: AF can cause changes in myocardial tension. Changes in myocardial tension may lead to increased secretion of NT Pro-BNP. We hypothesize that NT Pro-BNP may increase in AF with or without LAD enlargement., METHODS: This clinical study is an observational study and has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University. Ethical approval documents is attached. The study retrospectively reviewed 1345 patients with and without AF. After excluding 102 patients who were not eligible, the final total sample size was 1243 cases: AF group 679 patients (378, 55.7% males) and non-AF group 564 patients (287, 50.8% males). NT Pro-BNP was observed in AF group and non-AF group with or without LAD. After adjusting for age, gender, BMI, left atrial diameter, hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, and cerebral infarction, NT Pro-BNP remains statistically significant with AF., CONCLUSION: NT Pro-BNP can be used as a risk predictor of AF with or without left atrial enlargement.

In this Mendelian randomization (MR) study, we used large amounts of summary data from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) to further estimate the association of genetically predicted AAM with genetically predicated risk of MI and investigate to what extent this association is mediated by genetically determined lifestyles, cardiometabolic factors, and estrogen exposure. Method(s): A two-step, two-sample MR study was performed by mediation analysis. Genetic variants identified by GWAS meta-analysis of reproductive genetics consortium (n = 182,416) were selected for genetically predicted AAM. Genetic variants identified by the Coronary ARtery DIsease Genome-wide Replication and Meta-analysis plus The Coronary Artery Disease Genetics Consortium (n = 184,305) were selected for genetically predicted risk of MI. Genetic variants from other international GWAS summary data were selected for genetically determined mediators. Result(s): This MR study showed that increase in genetically predicted AAM was associated with lower risk of genetically predicted MI (odds ratio 0.91, 95% confidence interval 0.84-0.98). Inverse variance weighted (IVW) MR analysis also showed that decrease in genetically predicted AAM was associated with higher genetically predicted alcohol intake frequency, current smoking behavior, higher waist-to-hip ratio, and higher levels of systolic blood pressure (SBP), fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and triglycerides (TGs). Furthermore, increase in genetically predicted AAM was associated with genetically predicted longer sleep duration, higher levels of high-density lipoproteins, and older age at which hormone replacement therapy was started. The most essential mediators identified were genetically predicted current smoking behavior and levels of HbA1c, SBP, and TGs, which were estimated to genetically mediate 13.9, 12.2, 10.5, and 9.2%, respectively, with a combined mediation proportion of 37.5% in the association of genetically predicted AAM with genetically predicted increased risk of MI in an MR framework. Conclusion(s): Our MR analysis showed that increase in genetically predicted AAM was associated with lower genetically predicted risk of MI, which was substantially mediated by genetically determined current smoking behavior and levels of HbA1c, SBP, and TGs. Intervening on the above mediators may reduce the risk of MI.Copyright © 2022 Zheng, Chen, Huang, Shao, Li, Wang, Wang, Zhang, Meng, Gao, Wang, Liu, Song, Dong and Tang.","Authors":"Zheng, J.; Chen, K.; Huang, T.; Shao, C.; Li, P.; Wang, J.; Wang, W.; Zhang, K.; Meng, X.; Gao, J.; Wang, X.; Liu, Y.; Song, J.; Dong, E.; Tang, Y.

The effective recognition of high-risk subjects is critical for primary prevention in the general population. In the elderly cohort, anthropometric measurements may have different prognostic values. Our study aimed to find convincing anthropometric measures to supplement conventional risk factors for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in the elderly cohort. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 1,576 elderly participants (44.5% male, aged 72.0 +/- 6.0 years) recruited into the Northern Shanghai Study (2014-2015) were followed up between 2016 and 2017. Following the standard guideline for cardiovascular risk evaluation, all conventional cardiovascular risk factors were assessed. The body measures were made up of body weight, body height, hip circumference, waist circumference, and middle-upper arm circumference (MUAC). Organ damage (OD) markers for cardiac, vascular, and renal diseases will be evaluated by the standardized methods. Result(s): After the average 571 (+/-135) days of follow-up, a total of 90 MACEs (5.7%) occurred, i.e., 13 non-fatal myocardial infarction, 68 non-fatal stroke, and 9 cardiovascular deaths. Univariable COX survival analysis revealed that only MUAC could validly predict MACEs among anthropometric characters [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.89; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82-0.96]. In Kaplan-Meier analysis, the group of high MUAC showed the lowest MACE risk (log-rank p = 0.01). Based on OD analysis, MUAC was independently linked to higher risk of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in women and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) in both men and women. In adjusted COX analysis, only MUAC indicated statistical significance, but all other anthropometric parameters such as BMI, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) did not indicate significance. The higher level of MUAC remained a protective factor in fully adjusted models (HR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.59-0.91), with p-values markedly significant in men (HR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.49-0.97) and marginally significant in women (HR: 0.0.77; 95% CI: 0.59-1.01). After considering all factors (i.e., cardiovascular risk factors, MUAC, BMI, and WHR), the fully adjusted COX regression analysis demonstrated that the increased MUAC level was linked to decreased MACE risk in both men (HR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.37-0.88) and women (aHR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.46-0.93).

Material(s) and Method(s): Study data were obtained from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study; a total of 148 participants with a self-reported history of stroke and an equal volume of age- and sex-matched participants were selected as the cases and the controls in a case-control study; a total of 13,967 participants at the first follow-up and all participants with fatal stroke (up to April 2021) were included in a retrospective cohort study. Conditional logistic regression and the Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to assess the associations of the two genetic loci with the risk of stroke events. Result(s): After adjusting for age, sex, education, job, smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass index, physical activity, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, rs17817449 and rs6567160 shared minor alleles G and C, respectively, in the case-control analyses. The genotypes GG+GT of rs17817449 at the FTO were significantly associated with a decreased risk of fatal stroke occurrence, with fatal all strokes having an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 0.71 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.52-0.97, P = 0.04) and fatal ischemic stroke having an aHR of 0.64 (95% CI 0.41-1.00, P = 0.05), when the genotype TT was taken as a reference and a series of multiplicities were adjusted; the risk of fatal all strokes was lowered by dyslipidemia (aHR = 0.63, 95% CI 0.39-1.00, P = 0.05) and non-diabetes (aHR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.46-0.99, P = 0.049) in the retrospective cohort analyses. Significances were observed neither in the associations between rs6567160 and the risk of stroke events nor in an interaction between rs17817449 and rs6567160 in the two-stage analyses.

This study is trying to explore the association between IMT and sdLDL-C in Chinese acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) subjects. Method(s): This study enrolled total 368 consecutive AIS patients and 165 non-AIS controls from November 2016 to February 2019. Mean IMT and carotid plaques were measured by using carotid ultrasonography method. Blood glucose and lipid parameters were measured by using an automatic biochemical instrument. SdLDL-C was detected by using the Lipoprint LDL system. IMT > 1.0 mm was defined as increased IMT. Plaque stability based on the nature of the echo was determined by ultrasound examination. Risk factors for IMT were identified by using multivariate logistic regression analysis. A logistic regression model was established to predict AIS risk. Python software (Version 3.6) was used for the statistical analysis of all data. Result(s): The carotid IMT, proportion of plaques, and the sdLDL-C, triglycerides (TG) and glucose levels were obviously higher in AIS patients than those in controls. SdLDL-C level in the IMT thickening group was higher than that in the normal IMT group. SdLDL-C and total cholesterol (TC) were risk factors for IMT, while sdLDL-C was an independent risk factor. The IMT value of the unstable plaque group was markedly higher than that of the stable plaque group. The predictive value of IMT for AIS was better than that of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) but not as good as that of sdLDL-C. A logistic regression model was established to predict AIS risk. Additionally, carotid IMT and sdLDL-C were closely related to AIS severity and outcomes. Conclusion(s): SdLDL-C and TC were risk factors for increased IMT, while sdLDL-C was an independent risk factor. A prediction model based on IMT and other variables was established to screen the population with high AIS risk.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).","Authors":"Zhou, P.; Shen, Y.; Cao, Z.; Feng, W.; Liu, J.; Wang, L.; Meng, P.; Yang, J.; Xu, W.

Previous epidemiological research on obesity and AF often focused on adult populations and now broadened to earlier in life. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the relationships between obesity at different periods of life and the risk of AF. Method(s): A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study design using summarised data from 6 genome-wide association studies (GWASs) was employed in this study. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with adult obesity, childhood obesity, childhood body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI), birth weight and AF were independently retrieved from large-scale GWASs. For SNP identification, the genome-wide significance threshold was set at p <5.00x10-8. To obtain causal estimates, MR analysis was conducted using the inverse variance-weighted (IVW) method. The weighted median, MR-Egger methods and MR-robust adjusted profile score (MR-RAPS) were used to evaluate the robustness of MR analysis. Result(s): A total of 204 SNPs were identified as the genetic instrumental variables (5 SNPs for childhood obesity, 13 SNPs for childhood BMI, 137 SNPs for birth weight, 35 SNPs for adult WHRadjBMI, and 14 SNPs for adult obesity). The results of MR analysis demonstrated that the genetically predicted adult obesity, childhood BMI, and birth weight were associated with AF risk. Notably, a 1 unit standard deviation (1-SD) increase in adult obesity was related to a 13% increased risk of AF [p=6.51x10-7, OR, 1.13 (95% CI, 1.08-1.19)], a 1-SD increase in childhood BMI was related to a 18% increased risk of AF [p=1.77x10-4, OR, 1.18 (95% CI, 1.08-1.29)], and a 1-SD increase in birth weight was related to a 26% increased risk of AF [p=1.27x10-7, OR, 1.26 (95% CI, 1.16-1.37)]. There was no evidence of pleiotropy or heterogeneity between the MR estimates obtained from multiple SNPs. Conclusion(s): Our study reveals the association of genetic susceptibility to obesity with a higher risk of AF. Moreover, an earlier age at obesity was associated with an increased risk of AF. Therefore, public awareness of the dangers of obesity and active early weight control may prevent the development of AF.Copyright © The author(s).","Authors":"Zhou, Y.; Zha, L.; Pan, S.","Publisher":"International Journal of Medical Sciences","Issue":"9","DOI":"https://dx.doi.org/10.7150/ijms.72334","Pages":"1388-1398","Volume":"","QuickCitation":"","Outcomes":[],"ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"","DateCreated":"DD/MM/YYYY","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"","EditedBy":"","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"","Institution":"","Edition":"","Availability":"","URL":"","OldItemId":"","Comments":"","TypeName":"","ParentAuthors":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"","ItemStatusTooltip":"","Biomarker examples":"genetic prediction MR for earlier onset obesity"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":2,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":3,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":22,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":29,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":32,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":35,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":38,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":42,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":47,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":49,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":55,"ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"ItemId":4417,"Title":"Sex-specific added value of cardiac biomarkers for 10-year cardiovascular risk prediction","Year":2022,"Country":"","Abstract":"Aims: To evaluate the sex-specific predictive value of N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), high sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) and creatine kinase myocardial band (CK-MB) for 10-year risk prediction of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, heart failure (HF) and composite outcomes. Method(s): Five-thousand four-hundred thirty individuals (mean age 68.6 years, 59.9% women) from the Rotterdam Study, with biomarker measurements between 1997 and 2001, were included.

However, whether the observed association reflects causality requires clarification. We performed a bidirectional Mendelian randomisation (MR) study to assess the causal relationship of frailty, measured by the frailty index (FI), with coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke and type 2 diabetes (T2D)., METHODS: We extracted summary genome-wide association statistics for the FI (N = 175,226), CAD (Ncase = 60,801, Ncontrol = 123,504), stroke (Ncase = 40,585, Ncontrol = 406,111) and T2D (Ncase = 55,005, Ncontrol = 400,308) among individuals of European ancestry. Independent genetic variants associated with each phenotype at the genome-wide significance level were taken as instruments. Two-sample MR analyses were primarily conducted using the inverse-variance-weighted method, followed by various sensitivity and validation analyses., RESULTS: Genetically predicted higher FI was significantly associated with increased risk of CAD (odds ratio [OR] 1.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17-1.96) and T2D (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.31-2.47) and suggestively associated with higher risk of stroke (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.01-1.84). In the reverse direction analysis, genetic liability to CAD (beta 0.037, 95% CI 0.019-0.055), stroke (beta 0.096, 95% CI 0.051-0.141) and T2D (beta 0.047, 95% CI 0.036-0.059) showed significant associations with increased FI. Results were stable across sensitivity and validation analyses., CONCLUSION: Our study strengthened the evidence for a bidirectional causal association between frailty and cardiometabolic diseases. Further understanding of this association will be critical for the optimisation of care in older adults. Copyright © The Author(s) 2022.

Nevertheless, causality remains controversial. We conducted Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to examine whether handgrip strength and risk of CVDs are causally associated. Method(s): We identified 160 independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for right-hand grip strength and 136 independent SNPs for left-hand grip strength at the genome-wide significant threshold (P < 5 x 10-8) from UK Biobank participants and evaluated these in relation to risk of CVDs. MR estimates was calculated using the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method and multiple sensitivity analysis was further conducted.

We derived polygenic risk scores for these diseases. We tested whether a polygenic risk score could identify rare pathogenic variant heterozygotes among individuals with a parental disease history., RESULTS: Monogenic causes of complex diseases were more prevalent among individuals with a parental disease history than in the rest of the population. Polygenic risk scores showed moderate discriminative power to identify familial monogenic causes. For instance, we showed that prescreening the patients with a polygenic risk score for type 2 diabetes can prioritize individuals to undergo diagnostic sequencing for monogenic diabetes variants and reduce needs for such sequencing by up to 37%., CONCLUSION: Among individuals with a family history of complex diseases, those with a low polygenic risk score are more likely to have monogenic causes of the disease and could be prioritized to undergo genetic testing.

These estimates are highly concordant with clinical outcomes in breast cancer (BC) and familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) genes, where we distinguish between those with elevated versus population-level disease risk (logrank p<10-5, Risk Ratio=3.71 [3.53, 3.90] BC, Risk Ratio=4.71 [4.50, 4.92] FH), validated in an independent cohort (𝛘2 p=9.9x10-4 BC, 𝛘2 p=3.72x10-16 FH).
